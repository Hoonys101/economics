      "instruction_raw": "Scan the entire `tests/` directory to identify all Mock/MagicMock setups that use deprecated attribute names, specifically focusing on the recent Cockpit 2.0 refactor.\n\n**Target Mismatch:**\n- Old: `system_command_queue` (List-like)\n- New: `system_commands` (List[SystemCommand])\n\n**Objective:**\n1. Find every file in `tests/` where `system_command_queue` is assigned to a Mock or MagicMock.\n2. Identify if there are other stale attributes on `WorldState` mocks (e.g. `god_command_queue` vs naming in world_state.py).\n3. Provide a list of files and line numbers that need fixing.\n4. Check for `AttributeError: Mock object has no attribute...` patterns in recent failure logs if available.",
