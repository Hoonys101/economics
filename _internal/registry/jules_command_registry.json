      "instruction_raw": "\n        Pytest collection is experiencing a terminal 'stuck' point (hang) that occurs BEFORE root conftest.py telemetry can even log.\n        This is not a simple performance bottleneck, but a structural block.\n\n        1. [Diagnosis] Identify the 'Entry Point' block: Analyze 'main.py', 'config/__init__.py', and root-level '__init__.py' files for global initialization code.\n        2. [Fix] Hypothesis - Deadlock/Global Contention: If you find file locks (PlatformLockManager), singletons, or DB connections triggered during import, ISOLATE them.\n        3. [Fix] Audit 'pytest.ini' & Dependencies: Ensure heavy deps (sklearn, joblib) don't deadlock during test discovery.\n        4. [Mandate] Implement a structural fix to ensure core initialization ONLY triggers during runtime, not during test discovery.\n        5. [Verification] Run 'pytest --collect-only' to confirm the hang is resolved.\n        ",
