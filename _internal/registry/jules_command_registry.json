In SettlementSystem.transfer(), add M2-boundary detection: if sender is NON_M2 and receiver is M2, call record_monetary_expansion. If sender is M2 and receiver is NON_M2, call record_monetary_contraction.\n2. In SettlementSystem._create_transaction_record(), force executed=True for money_creation and money_destruction transaction types.\n3. In TransactionProcessor, register money_creation and money_destruction as explicit No-Op types to eliminate warnings.\nRun pytest after changes to ensure no regressions.",
