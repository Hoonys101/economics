# Audit Parity V2 Report

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Auditor:** Jules (AI Agent)
**Scope:** Priority Check of 3 Key Features from `project_status.md`

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Parity Score:** 100% (3/3 Verified)
- **Status:** All targeted high-priority features are confirmed to be implemented in the codebase as per specifications.
- **Ghost List:** None detected in the targeted scope.

## 2. Detailed Audit Results

### 1. Chemical Fertilizer (TFP x3.0)
- **Spec Reference:** WO-053 (Industrial Revolution) / Phase 23 / `project_status.md`
- **Target File:** `simulation/systems/technology_manager.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
- **Evidence:**
  - The `TechnologyManager._initialize_tech_tree` method explicitly initializes the `TechNode` for Chemical Fertilizer.
  - Code Snippet:
    ```python
    fertilizer = TechNode(
        id="TECH_AGRI_CHEM_01",
        name="Chemical Fertilizer (Haber-Bosch)",
        sector="FOOD",
        multiplier=3.0, # 300% TFP
        # ...
    )
    ```
  - The multiplier `3.0` matches the requirement "TFP x3.0".

### 2. TD-085: Mutual Exclusivity (Production/Hiring Pipeline)
- **Spec Reference:** TD-085 / `project_status.md` (implied via Standalone Engine Tasks)
- **Target File:** `simulation/decisions/standalone_rule_based_firm_engine.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
- **Evidence:**
  - The `make_decisions` method implements a strictly ordered sequential pipeline:
    1.  **Planning (Production):** `_adjust_production`
    2.  **Operation (Labor):** `_adjust_wages` / `_fire_excess_labor`
    3.  **Commerce (Pricing):** `_adjust_price_based_on_inventory`
  - Logic confirms `WO-110: Sequential execution` where labor needs are recalculated based on the *new* production targets from step 1, ensuring consistency.
  - The concerns are logically separated into distinct blocks, preventing a "big ball of mud" decision process.

### 3. TD-086: Newborn Engine Selection
- **Spec Reference:** TD-086 / Newborn Engine Type
- **Target File:** `simulation/systems/demographic_manager.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
- **Evidence:**
  - The `process_births` method retrieves the `NEWBORN_ENGINE_TYPE` configuration.
  - A conditional block explicitly switches between instantiating `RuleBasedHouseholdDecisionEngine` and `AIDrivenHouseholdDecisionEngine`.
  - Code Snippet:
    ```python
    newborn_engine_type = getattr(self.config_module, "NEWBORN_ENGINE_TYPE", "AIDriven")

    if newborn_engine_type == "RuleBased":
        # ...
    else:
        # ...
    ```

## 3. Conclusion
The "Precision Strike" audit confirms that the codebase accurately reflects the completed status of the checked items. No "Ghost Features" (marked complete but missing in code) were found in this sample.
