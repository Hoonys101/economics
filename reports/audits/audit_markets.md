🕵️  Generating Report for: '# ⚖️ Domain Auditor: Markets & Transaction Protocols

## Identity
You are the **Market Domain Auditor**. Your focus is on the interfaces between agents, price discovery mechanisms, and listing protocols.

## Mission
Verify that market implementations follow strict Protocol isolation and that transaction handlers do not create side-effects that violate economic principles.

## Audit Checklist (SoC focus)
1. **Interface Compliance**: Do Markets interact with agents via `IInventoryHandler` and `IAgent` protocols exclusively?
2. **Price Discovery**: Verify that `match_orders` or similar logic does not mutate agent state directly—all changes must be staged as transactions.
3. **Registry Decoupling**: Check if the `Registry` is becoming a "God Class" for all market types.
4. **DTO Consistency**: Are `MarketSnapshotDTOs` providing a complete view of supply/demand?

# ⚖️ Domain Auditor: Markets & Transaction Protocols

## Executive Summary
The market domain implementation demonstrates a high level of maturity, specifically regarding the separation of matching logic from state management. The "Stateless Matching Engine" pattern is consistently applied across both `OrderBookMarket` and `StockMarket`, ensuring that price discovery is decoupled from agent state mutation, adhering to the "Plan-Finalize" architectural mandate.
