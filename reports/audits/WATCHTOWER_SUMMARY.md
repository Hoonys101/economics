I will now aggregate the domain-specific findings into a comprehensive 'Project Watchtower Audit Report' and prepare the required session status updates.

# 🗼 Project Watchtower Audit Report: Session 17.x

## 1. 📍 Current Coordinates
- **Phase**: 17 (Performance & Integrity Optimization)
- **Work Orders**: WO-099 (Harvest Failure Analysis), WO-100 (Integer Penny Migration Phase 2)
- **Target Files**: `modules/market/matching_engine.py`, `modules/system/lifecycle_manager.py`

## 2. 🏛️ Global Architectural Drifts (Critical)
*   **Market Precision Leak (CRITICAL)**: While the `Finance` domain (SettlementSystem) has successfully migrated to integer pennies, the `Market` Matching Engines still utilize floating-point arithmetic for mid-price discovery. This creates "financial dust" that violates the Zero-Sum mandate.
*   **Sequencing 'God Manager'**: `LifecycleManager` has drifted from the decomposed Phase actor model, bundling Aging, Birth, Death, and Liquidation into a single monolithic call.
*   **Ghost Constant Binding**: Modules using `from config import PARAM` are binding values at import time, bypassing the `GlobalRegistry` and making dynamic tuning impossible.

## 3. ✅ Accomplishments
- **Mission Registry**: Transitioned to a structured JSON-based Mission Registry Service, retiring the legacy regex-based manifest editor.
- **Demographics O(1)**: Implemented an event-driven `DemographicManager` for O(1) tracking of population statistics.
- **Config Proxy**: Completed the hot-swap ready Config Proxy to support real-time simulation parameter adjustment.

## 4. 🚧 Blockers & Pending
*   **Float-to-Int Migration**: Markets remain the last major bastion of floating-point math in the core economic loop.
*   **Transaction Handler Redundancy**: Overlap between the legacy `TransactionManager` and the new `TransactionProcessor` is causing logic duplication.

## 5. 🧠 Warm Boot Message (Critical)
```text
System state is high-integrity for Finance and Agents. 
CAUTION: Market prices are currently drifting from the Zero-Sum integer mandate. 
NEXT ACTION: Refactor MatchingEngine to use integer arithmetic for all price/quantity calculations 
before scaling beyond 1k agents. Reference PHASE17_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md.
```

## 6. 📝 PROJECT_STATUS.md Updates (Proposed)
- **Add Phase 17.4**: Fixed-Point Market Discovery (Refactor `MatchingEngine` to integer math).
- **Add Phase 17.5**: `TransactionManager` Deprecation (Finalize migration to `TransactionProcessor`).

## 7. 📂 Handover Draft
Completed foundational Phase 17 infrastructure. The simulation is now capable of higher-frequency event processing via the new `DemographicManager`. However, financial integrity is at risk due to floating-point drift in the Market domain. Strategic focus must shift to harmonizing the `Market` domain with the `Finance` domain's integer penny standard.
