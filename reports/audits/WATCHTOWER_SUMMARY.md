I will read the project status and diagnostic files to gather the necessary context for the audit report.
# 🕵️ Project Watchtower Audit Report
**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Subject**: Post-Wave 3 Liquidation & Architectural Integrity Verification
**Auditor**: Lead Management Auditor (Aggregated Findings)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Following the completion of **Phase 19 (Waves 1-4)**, the simulation has achieved a **CRITICAL STABILITY** milestone. The "Great Agent Decomposition" and "Finance SSoT" initiatives have successfully eliminated the historical "God Class" liabilities.

The system currently reports **0.0000% Monetary Leakage** and a **100% Test Pass Rate (807/807)**. However, a residual **Architectural Drift** regarding numerical precision (`float` usage in `SettlementSystem`) remains the primary threat to long-term deterministic integrity.

## 2. Modular Domain Findings

### 🧬 Agents & Populations (Status: **SECURE**)
*   **Decomposition**: Households and Firms have successfully transitioned to the **Engine-Orchestrator** pattern.
*   **Protocol Compliance**: The `IAgent` and `IInventoryHandler` protocols are now strictly enforced. Direct attribute access (e.g., `agent.inventory`) has been replaced by verified DTO exchanges.
*   **Observation**: "Agent Soul" telemetry is functioning but requires UX hardening for better observability (Watchtower V2).

### 🏛️ Finance & Monetary Integrity (Status: **WARNING**)
*   **SSoT Integrity**: The `SettlementSystem` is now the undisputed Source of Truth (SSoT). Parallel ledgers have been dismantled.
*   **Zero-Sum**: All birth/death/transaction events are mathematically zero-sum.
*   **Drift Detected**: **Float Precision Residuals**. While current tests pass, the `SettlementSystem` still relies on `float` math in specific legacy vectors (`TaxService`, `MatchingEngine`). This violates the "Integer Core" mandate and poses a risk of non-deterministic drift over long-running simulations (Tick > 10,000).

### 📉 Markets & Transactions (Status: **STABLE**)
*   **Decoupling**: Market logic has been successfully extracted from Agents.
*   **Transaction Schema**: The migration to the new `Transaction` schema (Wave 3.2) is complete.
*   **Drift Detected**: **Legacy Redundancy**. The `TransactionManager` exists in parallel with the new `TransactionProcessor`, creating a potential "Split Brain" for transaction history retrieval.

### ⚙️ Systems & Infrastructure (Status: **SECURE**)
*   **Lifecycle**: Birth and Death events are now strictly orchestrated via `LifecycleManager` with no resource leaks.
*   **Persistence**: Mission Registry and JSON persistence are active.
*   **Performance**: No significant degradation observed post-refactor.

## 3. Global Architectural Drifts (Identified)

| Severity | Drift | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | **Float Precision** | Core financial engines (`SettlementSystem`) still process critical values as `float`. Must migrate to `int` (Micro-Pennies) immediately. |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | **Legacy Transaction Manager** | `TransactionManager` is redundant and technically debt-laden. It must be deprecated in favor of `TransactionProcessor`. |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | **Config Proxy Hygiene** | `ConfigProxy` implementation is functional but lacks final strict typing enforcement (Wave 5). |

## 4. Recommended Next Steps (Update for PROJECT_STATUS.md)

Based on these findings, the **PROJECT_STATUS.md** should be updated to prioritize the **"Integer Core"** initiative.

### ✅ Recommended Updates:

1.  **Activate Phase 16.3**: Formally declare "The Integer Core" phase.
2.  **Mission: Operation Penny Global**:
    *   **Target**: `modules/system/managers/settlement_manager.py` & `modules/finance/matching_engine.py`
    *   **Action**: Replace all `float` currency math with `int` (Micro-Penny standard).
3.  **Mission: Legacy Purge**:
    *   **Target**: `modules/finance/managers/transaction_manager.py`
    *   **Action**: Deprecate and remove. Ensure all queries route through `TransactionProcessor`.
