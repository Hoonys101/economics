Okay, I am the Lead Management Auditor. I will synthesize the findings from the individual domain audit reports into a single 'Project Watchtower Audit Report', identify global architectural drifts, and propose updates to `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with the recommended next steps.

I am ready to receive the modular audit reports for the Agents, Finance, Markets, and Systems domains.
