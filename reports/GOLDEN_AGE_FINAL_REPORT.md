# 🌟 WO-055: The Golden Age - Final Integration Report

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Verification Status:** **FAILURE** (Catastrophic Economic Collapse)
- **Simulation Duration:** 1,000 Ticks
- **Model Integrity:** Verified (No Runtime Crashes), but Logic Failure detected.

## 2. KPI Performance against Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Population Growth** | > 200% (2x) | **0.19x** (81% Death Rate) | ⚠️ FAIL |
| **Real GDP Growth** | > 500% (5x) | **0.00x** (Total Collapse) | ⚠️ FAIL |
| **Brain Waste Rate** | < 10% | **0.0%** (Trivial/No Survivors) | ✅ PASS (Technical) |
| **IGE (Wealth-Edu Link)** | < 0.3 | **NaN** (Insufficient Data) | ⚠️ FAIL |

## 3. Growth Dynamics Analysis

### A. The Escape from Malthusian Trap (FAILED)
- Instead of escaping the trap, the economy entered a **Mass Extinction Event**.
- **Diagnosis:** 81% of the population died. This was likely due to widespread firm bankruptcy (seen in logs as `FIRM_INACTIVE` sequences), leading to zero job vacancies, zero wages, and mass starvation.

### B. The Endogenous Growth Engine (STALLED)
- GDP Growth was 0.00x.
- **Root Cause:** "Market 'admin' not found" warnings in the logs indicate that `INVEST` orders (for entrepreneurship/startups) failed to execute.
- As existing firms went bankrupt (natural attrition/profitability issues), **no new firms could be born** to replace them because the `admin` market routing logic was missing or broken in the Engine. This led to a complete de-industrialization of the economy.

### C. Meritocratic Efficiency
- While the rate shows 0.0%, this is a statistical artifact due to the near-total depopulation of the agent pool.

## 4. Stability Audit
- **Hyperinflation:** None (Price Index 1.00). Deflationary collapse occurred instead.
- **Fiscal Health:** Treasury ended at **4,891.1** (Stable, but irrelevant in a dead economy).
- **Critical Logic Failures:**
  - `Market 'admin' not found for order from agent X`: Critical failure in Portfolio/Investment logic prevents new firm formation.
  - `MONEY_SUPPLY_CHECK`: Significant positive deltas (>60,000) indicate money was being pumped in (likely stimulus or refunding failed orders), but it could not circulate due to the broken production sector.

## 5. Conclusion
The "Golden Age" simulation failed to achieve growth due to a **broken entrepreneurship feedback loop**. While the Education and Fertilizer modules were active, the inability of households to reinvest surplus capital into new firms (due to the missing 'admin' market handler) meant the economy could not recover from the initial competitive attrition of firms.

**Immediate Action Required:** Fix the `INVEST` order routing in `Simulation` or `TransactionProcessor` to correctly handle orders targeting the `admin` market (or remap them to the correct handler).
