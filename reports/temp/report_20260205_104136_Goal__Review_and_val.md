I have completed the audit of the Watchtower specifications. The `write_file` tool is unavailable, so I cannot create the report file at `communications/insights/WATCHTOWER_SPEC_AUDIT.md`. I am presenting the full report below.

# Report: Watchtower Specification Audit (PH6)

## Executive Summary
The Watchtower specifications provide a robust and scalable architectural foundation. However, there is a critical disconnect between the diagnostic metrics required by the scenarios in the content spec and the data currently generated by the simulation's backend. The API contract is well-defined but incomplete, missing key fields required for the Politics and Population pages.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Phenomenon-Indicator Alignment
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partial
- **Notes**: Several key metrics required to diagnose the specified economic scenarios are not currently calculated by `simulation/metrics/economic_tracker.py`. This represents a significant data gap.

| Scenario | Required Indicator | Spec Status | Backend Status | Evidence (If Missing) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **A: Monetary Expansion** | CPI, M2, Base Rate | ✅ Found | ✅ Found | N/A |
| **B: Liquidity Trap** | Base Rate, Call Rate, GDP | ✅ Found | ✅ Found | N/A |
| **C: Social Tipping Point**| Gini Coefficient, Approval (Quintile) | ✅ Found | ❌ Missing | `economic_tracker.py` does not calculate Gini. Approval is not tracked. |
| **D: Malthusian Trap** | Population, Food Production, Needs | ✅ Found | ✅ Found | N/A |
| **E: The Great Leveler** | Mortality/Wages by Demo/Income | ✅ Found | ❌ Missing | `economic_tracker.py` tracks `avg_wage` only, not by sector/demographic. |

### 2. API Completeness
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partial
- **Notes**: The `WatchtowerSnapshotDTO` in both the API spec and the Python implementation (`simulation/dtos/watchtower.py`) is missing several fields required by the content spec (`PH6_WATCHTOWER_CONTENT_SPEC.md`).

- <details>
  <summary><b>Missing Fields in DTO/API:</b></summary>

  - **Politics Page (`POLITICS_GAUGES`)**:
    - ❌ `Social Cohesion`: Not defined in `TheWatchtowerSnapshotDTO`. (`PH6_WATCHTOWER_CONTENT_SPEC.md`)
    - ❌ `Governance Status`: Not defined in `TheWatchtowerSnapshotDTO`. (`PH6_WATCHTOWER_CONTENT_SPEC.md`)
  - **Population Page (`POPULATION_CENSUS`)**:
    - ❌ `distribution`: The `Map<Quintile, float>` for asset distribution is in the API Spec's TS example but missing from the Python `TheWatchtowerSnapshotDTO`. (`PH6_WATCHTOWER_API_SPEC.md`, `simulation/dtos/watchtower.py`)
  - **Inconsistency**:
    - ⚠️ The Politics page spec requires `National Debt/GDP`, but the API and DTO provide only `debt`. (`PH6_WATCHTOWER_CONTENT_SPEC.md` vs `PH6_WATCHTOWER_API_SPEC.md`)
  </details>

### 3. Scalability
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Evidence**: `design/3_work_artifacts/specs/PH6_WATCHTOWER_CONTENT_SPEC.md:L4-12`
- **Notes**: The "Slot & Component" pattern combined with the `CHANGE_SCENARIO` command provides a robust and scalable architecture for future extensions and dynamic reconfiguration.

### 4. Technical Integrity
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Evidence**: `simulation/dtos/watchtower.py`, `design/3_work_artifacts/specs/PH6_WATCHTOWER_API_SPEC.md:L50-70`
- **Notes**: The Python `TheWatchtowerSnapshotDTO` and the TypeScript `WatchtowerSnapshot` interface are almost perfectly aligned. The 1Hz throttling is a reasonable default for this type of application.

## Risk Assessment
> [!CAUTION]
> **High Risk of Rework**: Proceeding to frontend development without addressing the data gaps will result in either broken UI components or significant rework. The backend (`economic_tracker.py`) cannot currently supply the data needed to fulfill the diagnostic requirements of the content specification.

## Conclusion
**NEEDS REVISION**.

While the architectural vision is sound, the specification is not ready for implementation. The backend data layer must be enhanced to produce the missing metrics, and the API DTOs must be updated to fully align with the content requirements before frontend development commences.
