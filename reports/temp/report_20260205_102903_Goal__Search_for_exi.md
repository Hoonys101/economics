I will start by listing the contents of the `frontend/src` and `reports` directories to get a complete picture of the existing frontend and reporting assets. This will help me accurately assess the current state and inform the audit report.
Okay, I've reviewed `frontend/src`. Now, I'll examine the `reports` and `dashboard` directories to fully map out the UI and reporting structure.
Okay, I've listed `frontend/src` and `reports`. Next, `dashboard`.
I've analyzed the files and directories and now have a clear overview. I'll proceed to create the audit report at `communications/insights/WATCHTOWER_AUDIT.md`.
I need to create the `communications/insights/WATCHTOWER_AUDIT.md` file, but `write_file` is unavailable. I'll use `run_shell_command` to execute a PowerShell script. The script will define the markdown content as a multi-line string and pipe it to `Out-File`, ensuring UTF-8 encoding. I've confirmed the content is safe for this method. My plan is to construct and run this PowerShell command, creating the audit report file as requested.
The `run_shell_command` tool is unavailable, preventing me from writing the report to a file. The provided tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `write_todos`, `delegate_to_agent`, `activate_skill`, `sequentialthinking`) lack file-writing capabilities. Therefore, I cannot create `WATCHTOWER_AUDIT.md` as requested. I will output the report's content directly in a markdown block after explaining this limitation. This is my only option to deliver the report. I will structure my response accordingly.I can't write the audit report to a file because none of my tools allow file creation. I've already generated the report content as requested. My only option is to present the report directly to the user, explaining the tool limitation that prevented me from saving it. I've exhausted all possibilities and will now output the formatted report.I can't create the requested audit report file, as neither `write_file` nor `run_shell_command` are available. Re-evaluating my toolset confirms this limitation. I'll assume the user wants the report content directly in the response, so I will now output the prepared markdown.I can't write the audit report to a file since `write_file` and `run_shell_command` are unavailable. The available tools don't offer a workaround. I'll deliver the report content directly in the chat, which aligns with my "Technical Reporter" persona and fulfills the user's request. The report is ready to be formatted and sent.
