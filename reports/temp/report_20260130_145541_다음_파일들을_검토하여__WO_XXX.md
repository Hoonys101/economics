# Report: Documentation Placeholder Analysis

## Executive Summary
A self-referential placeholder `(WO-XXX)` was found in the `TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md` file within the description of the technical debt item `TD-143`. This report provides the necessary change to resolve this documentation inconsistency, as per the guidelines in `WO-143`.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Placeholder Identification
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Evidence**: The file `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md` contains the placeholder.
- **Notes**: The entry for `TD-143` ironically contains the very placeholder that its corresponding Work Order (`WO-143`) is meant to eliminate.

## Conclusion & Action Item
As a Technical Reporter, I analyze and report findings but do not modify files. To resolve this issue, the following change should be applied to `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`:
