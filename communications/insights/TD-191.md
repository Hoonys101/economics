# Public Manager ID Standardization and Compliance

## Problem
The `PublicManager` class, responsible for asset recovery and liquidation, failed to strictly comply with the `IFinancialEntity` interface.
*   **Type Mismatch**: `IFinancialEntity.id` requires an `int`, but `PublicManager` returned `"PUBLIC_MANAGER"` (str).
*   **System Fragility**: Hardcoded string checks (`if seller_id == "PUBLIC_MANAGER"`) in `TransactionProcessor` and `TransactionManager` created tight coupling and made it difficult to treat the Public Manager as a standard financial entity.
*   **Settlement Risk**: `SettlementSystem` attempts to cast IDs to `int` for bank operations, which would cause runtime errors if `PublicManager` ever needed to interact with the banking system via standard paths.

## Solution
1.  **Standardized ID**: `PublicManager.id` now returns `-1` (int), aligning with `IFinancialEntity`.
2.  **Interface Compliance**: Fully implemented `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `assets` methods in `PublicManager`.
3.  **Robust Transaction Routing**: Updated `TransactionProcessor` (and legacy `TransactionManager`) to identify the Public Manager by its integer ID (`-1`) or the legacy string (for backward compatibility during transition).
4.  **Order Generation**: `PublicManager` now generates liquidation orders using its integer ID.

## Insights
*   **System Agents**: Assigning negative integer IDs (e.g., `-1`, `-2`) to system agents (Public Manager, Central Bank) is a robust pattern to distinguish them from simulation agents (Households, Firms) while maintaining type safety.
*   **Protocol Enforcement**: Strict protocol adherence (like `IFinancialEntity`) is crucial for shared systems like `SettlementSystem` to function without special-casing every entity type.
