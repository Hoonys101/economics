# TD-187: Liquidation Waterfall Protocol Implementation Insights

## Overview
Implemented the Liquidation Waterfall Protocol to prioritize employee entitlements (Severance, Unpaid Wages) over other creditors during firm liquidation.

## Key Changes
1.  **LiquidationManager**: New system component (`simulation/systems/liquidation_manager.py`) managing the waterfall logic.
2.  **Claim Logic**:
    *   **Tier 1**: Employee Severance (based on tenure, capped at 3 years) & Unpaid Wages.
    *   **Tier 2**: Secured Debt (Bank Loans).
    *   **Tier 3**: Taxes (estimated current liability).
    *   **Tier 5**: Equity (Shareholders).
3.  **Tenure Tracking**: Added `employment_start_tick` to `Household` (EconStateDTO) and initialized on hire in `HRDepartment`.
4.  **Unpaid Wage Tracking**: `HRDepartment` now tracks unpaid wages in `unpaid_wages` dictionary instead of just logging "Zombie" state.
5.  **Integration**: `AgentLifecycleManager` uses `LiquidationManager` before clearing employees/assets.

## Technical Debt & Observations
*   **SettlementSystem dependency**: `LiquidationManager` relies on `SettlementSystem` which usually requires Agent objects. Handling "government" or external creditors purely by string ID might be fragile if `SettlementSystem` expects objects. Currently, we try to resolve string IDs to objects via `state.agents`.
*   **Government Agent**: The code assumes `state.government` exists. If not, tax payments might be skipped or fail.
*   **Shareholder Access**: Retrieving shareholders relies on iterating `state.households`. Ideally, `StockMarket` should expose a "get shareholders for firm" method that returns Agent objects, but `StockMarket` might only store IDs.
*   **Negative Ticks**: Tenure calculation ignores employment start ticks < 0. If pre-simulation history implies negative start ticks, they are currently excluded from severance.
*   **Tax Calculation**: We use a simplified tax calculation based on `current_profit`. It does not account for historical unpaid taxes (which are not explicitly tracked in a ledger currently).

## Verification
*   Unit tests in `tests/unit/systems/test_liquidation_manager.py` verify claim calculation and distribution logic.
*   Integration tests in `tests/integration/test_liquidation_waterfall.py` verify priority of employees over shareholders.
