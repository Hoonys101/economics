# TDL-029: Add python-dotenv and joblib to requirements.txt

## Status
Complete (Verified Existing)

## Findings
The task requested adding `python-dotenv` and `joblib` to `requirements.txt`.
Upon inspection, these dependencies were already present in `requirements.txt`:

- `joblib>=1.3.0`
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`

## Technical Debt / Insights
- **Discrepancy with Documentation**: `design/HANDOVER.md` states that `python-dotenv` and `joblib` are missing, but the actual file contradicts this. The documentation appears to be outdated or the task was previously applied without updating the documentation/tracker.
- **Action Taken**: No changes were made to `requirements.txt` as it already satisfies the requirement. This report confirms the verification.
