# 🛑 HANDOVER REPORT (2026-01-14)

**Status**: 🚧 Partial Success (Tools Ready, Economy Needs CPR)
**Next Actor**: Antigravity (Team Leader)
**Context**: Gemini Worker System Setup & Preparation

---

## 📍 Current Coordinates
- **Phase**: 24. Adaptive Intelligence & Evolution
- **Active Task**: `Economic CPR (Production Rescue)`
- **Key Files**: `scripts/gemini_worker.py`, `scripts/pr_manager.py`, `task.md`
- **State**: Automation tools deployed. Spec Worker verification in progress. Economy halted (GDP=0, L=0, K=0) requiring immediate bootstrap.

## ✅ Accomplishments (Session Highlights)
- **Gemini Worker System Deployed**:
 - `gemini_worker.py` implemented with `spec`, `verify`, `context`, `git`, `reporter` modes.
 - Context-aware spec generation tested (Engine only: ✅, Contract context: 🚧).
- **Automation Suite Enhanced**:
 - `pr_manager.py`: Added auto-merge and branch cleanup capabilities.
 - `test_doctor.py`: Implemented for automated log analysis and summary.
 - `checkpoint.py`: Integrated `Consistency Guard` and `Handover Auto-Gen`.
- **Administrative**:
 - `task.md` established for structured task management.
 - Project context and team roles verified.

## 🚧 Blockers & Pending
- **[CRITICAL] Economic Stagnation ()**:
 - Production inputs (Labor, Capital) and Supply are effectively zero.
 - Need to execute "Bootstrap Fix" (Init Inventory Injection) immediately.
- **Spec Worker Verification**:
 - "Contract Context" test for `gemini_worker.py` is incomplete (`[/]`).
 - Need to verify if providing `dtos.py` reduces hallucination in spec generation.
- **Tech Debt**:
 - `TD-005` (Halo Effect) & `TD-006` (Caste System) remain recognized but unaddressed.

## 🧠 Warm Boot Message (For Next Session)
> "Tools are ready, but the patient is dying. We successfully built the **Gemini Worker System** and automation scripts (`pr_manager`, `test_doctor`). However, the economy is in a coma () with zero production.
>
> **Immediate Action Required**:
> 1. **Verify Spec Worker**: Complete the 'Contract Context' test to ensure reliable spec generation.
> 2. **Execute **: Use the verified worker to generate the spec for `Production Rescue` (Inventory Injection).
> 3. **Revive Economy**: Implement the fix and verify GDP > 0."
