## 🚦 2. Status & Roadmaps
Current progress and the technical context of the simulation.
- **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](../project_status.md)**: Current build status and next tasks.
- **[ROADMAP.md](../roadmap.md)**: The long-term architectural vision.
- **[TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md](TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md)**: Unresolved debts and remediation plans.
- **[Handover Documents](../handovers/)**: Context from previous work sessions.
