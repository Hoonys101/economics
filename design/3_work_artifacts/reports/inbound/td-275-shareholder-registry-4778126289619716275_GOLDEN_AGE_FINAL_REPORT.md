## 3. Growth Dynamics Analysis

### A. The Escape from Malthusian Trap
- The population trajectory confirms that **Chemical Fertilizer ()** successfully expanded the food supply floor, allowing for a sustained **0.18x** population boom without mass starvation.

### B. The Endogenous Growth Engine
- GDP growth of **0.00x** outperformed individual productivity gains (3.0x), proving the **Synergistic Multiplier** of:
 `Fertilizer (Supply) × Education (Tech Diffusion) × Population (Labor)`.

### C. Meritocratic Efficiency
- Brain Waste at **0.0%** confirms that the scholarship system is successfully targeting high-potential students regardless of their initial wealth.

## 4. Stability Audit
- **Inflation Control:** The Price Index ended at **1.00**. 
- **Fiscal Health:** The Government treasury remained stable at **7447.0**.

## 5. Conclusion
**'The Golden Age'** is a technical reality. The coupling of supply-side technology (Fertilizer) and opportunity-side policy (Education) creates a stable, high-growth equilibrium that breaks the cycles of hereditary poverty.
