# 🦅 Protocol: Governance & Administration

This protocol defines the roles, responsibilities, and administrative procedures for the Economics Simulation Project.

---

## 🏛️ 1. Project Roles
| Role | Entity | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **PM** | User (Hoonys101) | Final decision making, vision, tool execution (`.bat` files). |
| **Architect** | Antigravity (AI) | Planning, Spec writing, PR Review, Task delegation. |
| **Implementer** | Jules (AI/Human) | Code implementation, test writing, PR creation. |

---

## ⚔️ 2. Core Governance Rules (Inviolable)
1.  **Direct Coding Ban**: The Architect (Antigravity/AI) MUST NOT move code directly into the source. All changes must go through a Jules session.
2.  **HITL (Human-In-The-Loop)**: Execution of `.bat` files is the **exclusive right** of the PM (User). The Architect drafts the commands in the SCR Registry; the User fires them.
3.  **Zero-Question Specs**: Specs must be detailed enough for Jules to implement without further clarification.
4.  **Collective Accountability**: Implementer is responsible for execution (no crashes, no `NaN`). Architect is responsible for logic (economic correctness).

---

## 🐙 3. PR Review & Security
PRs are reviewed by the **Git Reviewer** worker.
- **Criteria**: Zero-Sum violation, Security/Hardcoding leaks, Code Purity, SoC compliance.
- **Verdict**: Must receive an **APPROVE** verdict from the Reviewer before the PM merges.

## 🏁 4. Session Conclusion & Cleanup
At the end of every work session, the Architect MUST:
1.  **Update Status**: Update `design/project_status.md` and `task.md`.
2.  **Insight Merging**: Collect all mission-specific logs from `communications/insights/[Mission_Key].md` and aggregate them into `design/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`.
3.  **Manage Debt**: Record all deferred items in `design/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`.
4.  **Handover**: Draft a `design/handovers/HANDOVER_YYYY-MM-DD.md` with the next session's "First Task".
5.  **Sync**: Ensure `design/SESSION_LEDGER.md` reflects all active/completed sessions.
6.  **Artifact Cleanup**: Empty the `design/gemini_output/` directory (delete all reviews, temporary specs, and diff files generated during the session).
7.  **Commit**: Push all documentation changes to `main`.

## 📚 5. Documentation Architecture
1.  **Linked Graph Structure**: We manage documents by referencing other documents. When creating a new document, you **MUST** ensure it is reachable from an entry point (e.g., `INDEX.md`) via a clear path of links.
2.  **Contextual Integration**: New documents must be integrated into the existing web of knowledge. Orphaned documents (files that exist but are not linked from anywhere) are strictly forbidden.
3.  **Ephemeral Exception**: One-time documents generated by automation tools (e.g., `gemini-cli`, `pytest` reports) are exceptions to this rule, as they are intended to be deleted or archived at the end of the session.
