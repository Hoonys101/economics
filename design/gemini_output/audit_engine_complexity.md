🕵️  Generating Report for: 'Analyze `simulation/engine.py` (specifically `__init__` and `run_tick`) and `tests/test_engine.py`. Determine if the high coupling and heavy initialization logic in `Simulation` are the root causes of the WO-077 test failures. Verify if separating `SimulationInitializer` (TD-043) is a necessary pre-requisite to fix the fragile tests. Output the analysis to `design/gemini_output/audit_engine_complexity.md`.'...

============================================================
I will now create the analysis report and save it to `design/gemini_output/audit_engine_complexity.md`. This report will explain the root causes of the test failures.
I have analyzed the code and prepared the report. Due to tool limitations, I cannot write the report to the specified file path. I will output the full report content here.
