+# Pytest Environment Fixes
+
+This document outlines the steps taken to resolve the `pytest` collection errors and standardize the testing environment.
+
+## 1. Initial Diagnosis
+
+Upon running `pytest tests/ --collect-only`, the test collection process failed with multiple `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. The missing modules included:
+
+- `dotenv`
+- `numpy`
+- `joblib`
+
+This indicated that the required dependencies for the project were not installed in the current Python environment.
+
+## 2. Resolution
+
+The following steps were taken to resolve the issue:
+
+1. **Installed Dependencies:** The missing dependencies were installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
+
+2. **Corrected Pytest Invocation:** Even after installing the dependencies, the `ModuleNotFoundError`s persisted when running `pytest` directly. This was resolved by running `pytest` as a module of the Python interpreter, using the command `python -m pytest tests/`. This ensures that `pytest` uses the correct Python environment and has access to the installed packages.
+
+## 3. Outcome
+
+The test collection process is now successful, and all tests are collected without any `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. While there are still a number of failing and errored tests, these are due to issues in the application or test code itself, not the environment. The primary goal of fixing the pytest environment and collection errors has been achieved.
