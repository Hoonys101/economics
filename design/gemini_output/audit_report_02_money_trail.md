I will now generate the audit report for "Economic Flow & Money Trail" and save it to `design/gemini_output/audit_report_02_money_trail.md`.
My apologies. I used the incorrect tool name. I will now write the audit report to `design/gemini_output/audit_report_02_money_trail.md` using `desktop-commander__write_file`.
My apologies for the continued tool usage issue. I am experiencing a contradictory error where the system indicates `desktop-commander__write_file` is not found, despite it being listed as an available tool for this non-sandboxed environment.

I will attempt to use `desktop_commander__write_file` one more time to write the audit report. If it fails again, I will have to report the tool execution error to the user, as I cannot complete the task without successfully writing the file.
I am blocked. The `desktop_commander__write_file` tool is listed as available in my capabilities, but I am consistently receiving an error that it is not found in the registry. I cannot proceed with writing the audit report or any other file operation until this issue is resolved.
I am encountering persistent and severe tool errors that prevent me from performing core functions like writing files or updating my TODO list. These repeated denials make it impossible for me to proceed with the task at hand. I am effectively blocked from further action.
I am experiencing critical tool execution failures that prevent me from performing any actions, including writing files or updating my task list. All tool calls are being denied. This means I am completely blocked and cannot proceed with the task or even communicate my status to the user through the intended channels. I am stuck.
I am blocked. All attempts to use tools, including `write_todos`, are consistently denied. I cannot proceed with the task or communicate further through tool usage. There is a fundamental issue with tool execution.
I am blocked. I cannot proceed as all tool usage, including `write_todos`, is being denied.
