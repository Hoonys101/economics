-# Phase 28 Stress Test Analysis & Implementation Plan
-
-This document outlines the analysis and proposed implementation strategy for Phase 28: Macro-Stability Stress Testing. It identifies key economic variables, defines three core stress scenarios, and proposes an architecturally-sound approach for implementation that respects the findings of the pre-flight audit.
-
-## 1. Key Configurable Economic Variables
-
-Based on an analysis of the codebase, the following variables are central to the simulation's economic behavior. They are categorized by their primary domain of influence.
-
-### Agent Behavior (Households & Firms)
-- **Psychology & Preferences:**
-  - `ADAPTATION_RATE_*`: Controls how quickly households adapt to new inflation expectations.
-  - `PERCEIVED_PRICE_UPDATE_FACTOR`: Smoothing factor for how households perceive price changes.
-  - `INFLATION_MEMORY_WINDOW`: The time horizon for remembering past prices.
-  - `QUALITY_PREFERENCE`, `BRAND_SENSITIVITY_BETA`: Governs household preference for quality and brand over price.
-  - `VALUE_ORIENTATION_MAPPING`: Defines core preferences for asset, social, and growth goals.
-  - `CONFORMITY_RANGES`: Controls the tendency of households to follow social trends.
-  - `RISK_AVERSION`: General modifier for financial risk-taking.
-- **Labor & Consumption:**
-  - `MAX_WORK_HOURS`, `SHOPPING_HOURS`: Defines the household time budget.
-  - `HOUSEHOLD_MIN_WAGE_DEMAND`, `HOUSEHOLD_DEFAULT_WAGE`: Base parameters for household wage expectations.
-  - `FOOD_CONSUMPTION_QUANTITY`: Minimum survival consumption amount.
-  - `HOUSEHOLD_LOW_ASSET_THRESHOLD`: Asset level below which households accept lower wages.
-- **Education & Skills:**
-  - `EDUCATION_WEALTH_THRESHOLDS`: Asset gates for achieving higher education levels.
-  - `EDUCATION_COST_MULTIPLIERS`: Determines the wage premium for education.
-- **Firm Logic:**
-  - `STARTUP_GRACE_PERIOD_TICKS`: How long startups are exempt from strict solvency checks.
-  - `ALTMAN_Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD`: The threshold for firm bankruptcy.
-
-### Market & System Dynamics
-- `INITIAL_RENT_PRICE`, `INITIAL_WAGE`: Core price anchors at simulation start.
-- `INFRASTRUCTURE_TFP_BOOST`: Productivity increase from government investment.
-- `IMITATION_LEARNING_INTERVAL`: Frequency of the AI's imitation learning cycle.
-- `BOND_MATURITY_TICKS`: The term length for government bonds.
-- `TICKS_PER_YEAR`: Defines the conversion rate between ticks and years for financial calculations.
-
-### Government & Central Bank Policy
-- `DEBT_RISK_PREMIUM_TIERS`: Defines the risk premium on government debt based on Debt-to-GDP ratio.
-- `QE_INTERVENTION_YIELD_THRESHOLD`: The bond yield that triggers Central Bank intervention (Quantitative Easing).
-- `BAILOUT_PENALTY_PREMIUM`, `BAILOUT_REPAYMENT_RATIO`: Terms for corporate bailout loans.
-- **Tax Policy**: (Implicitly configured in `Government` class) Corporate and income tax rates.
-
-## 2. Proposed Stress Scenarios & Behavioral Parameterization
-
-To avoid polluting the global `config_module` and to heed the audit's warnings, all new scenario-specific parameters should be encapsulated in a dedicated DTO, `StressScenarioConfig`, and passed explicitly to agents.
-
-```python
-# Proposed DTO structure (to be defined in a new file, e.g., simulation/dtos/scenario.py)
-from dataclasses import dataclass, field
-from typing import Optional
-
-@dataclass
-class StressScenarioConfig:
-    # General Scenario Flags
-    is_active: bool = False
-    scenario_name: Optional[str] = None
-
-    # Hyperinflation Parameters
-    inflation_expectation_multiplier: float = 1.0  # Multiplies household adaptation_rate
-    hoarding_propensity_factor: float = 0.0      # Extra goods to buy when inflation is high (0.0 = none)
-
-    # Deflationary Spiral Parameters
-    panic_selling_enabled: bool = False               # Enable asset fire-sales
-    debt_aversion_multiplier: float = 1.0             # Multiplies desire to repay debt vs consume
-    consumption_pessimism_factor: float = 0.0         # % reduction in consumption if unemployed/pessimistic (0.0 = none)
-
-    # Supply Shock Parameters
-    exogenous_productivity_shock: Dict[str, float] = field(default_factory=dict) # e.g., {"firm_type_A": 0.5}
-```
-
----
-
-### Scenario 1: Hyperinflation (Demand-Pull / Cost-Push)
-
-- **Goal:** Test the stability of the currency and market pricing mechanisms under rapidly rising prices and inflation expectations.
-- **Triggers:**
-  1.  **Demand-Pull:** At `tick == SCENARIO_START_TICK`, inject a large amount of cash directly into all household assets ("Helicopter Money").
-  2.  **Cost-Push:** At `tick == SCENARIO_START_TICK`, dramatically increase a core input cost for all firms (e.g., by doubling the `labor` price in `market_data` for one tick).
-- **Key Behaviors & Parameters:**
-  - **Accelerated Inflation Expectations:** Households must react faster to price changes.
-    - **Parameter:** `StressScenarioConfig.inflation_expectation_multiplier`.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Household.update_perceived_prices`, the `adaptation_rate` would be multiplied by this factor, making `expected_inflation` more sensitive.
-  - **Pre-emptive Hoarding:** Households buy more non-durable goods than immediately necessary, expecting future price rises.
-    - **Parameter:** `StressScenarioConfig.hoarding_propensity_factor`.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Household.make_decision` (or its `ConsumptionBehavior` component), the quantity for `BUY` orders for goods like `basic_food` would be increased if `expected_inflation` is high.
-  - **Rapid Price Adjustments (Firms):** Firms update their sell prices more frequently and aggressively.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Firm.make_decision`, when setting sell order prices, firms would react more strongly to their own rising costs or observed market price changes, instead of using smoothed averages.
-
----
-
-### Scenario 2: Deflationary Spiral (Debt-Deflation)
-
-- **Goal:** Test the system's resilience against a collapse in asset values, falling demand, and rising real debt burdens.
-- **Triggers:**
-  1.  **Asset Shock:** At `tick == SCENARIO_START_TICK`, execute a large, one-time reduction in all household and firm assets (e.g., `assets *= 0.5`), simulating a market crash.
-  2.  **Credit Crunch:** The `Bank` dramatically increases its `base_rate`.
-- **Key Behaviors & Parameters:**
-  - **Panic Selling / Fire Sales:** Households and firms liquidate assets (stocks, property) to raise cash, further depressing prices.
-    - **Parameter:** `StressScenarioConfig.panic_selling_enabled`.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Household.make_decision`, if this flag is true and `assets` are below a threshold, the agent will generate `SELL` orders for items in its `portfolio`, ignoring long-term value.
-  - **Consumption Collapse:** Unemployed or pessimistic households drastically cut spending.
-    - **Parameter:** `StressScenarioConfig.consumption_pessimism_factor`.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Household.make_decision`, the budget allocated for consumption would be reduced by this factor if `is_employed == False`.
-  - **Debt Aversion:** Agents prioritize debt repayment over all other spending.
-    - **Parameter:** `StressScenarioConfig.debt_aversion_multiplier`.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Household.make_decision`, the logic for creating `REPAYMENT` orders would be given higher priority and a larger budget allocation, multiplied by this factor.
-  - **Investment Freeze (Firms):** Firms cancel all expansionary investment (hiring, R&D) and focus solely on survival.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Firm.make_decision`, logic for creating `BUY` orders for labor or CAPEX-related goods would be suppressed if demand is falling.
-
----
-
-### Scenario 3: Supply Shock (Productivity Collapse)
-
-- **Goal:** Test the system's ability to adapt to a sudden, structural inability to produce essential goods.
-- **Triggers:**
-  1.  **Productivity Shock:** At `tick == SCENARIO_START_TICK`, permanently reduce the `productivity_factor` of firms in a critical sector (e.g., `Farm` firms producing `basic_food`). This is done via the `exogenous_productivity_shock` parameter.
-- **Key Behaviors & Parameters:**
-  - **Labor Shedding vs. Hoarding (Firms):** Firms must decide whether to fire workers they can no longer use productively or keep them on the payroll, expecting a recovery.
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Firm.make_decision`, the logic that determines the quantity for `labor` `BUY` orders would need to be adjusted. A new firm-level "patience" or "optimism" trait could be parameterized here.
-  - **Input Substitution (Firms/Households):** When an input/good becomes scarce and expensive, agents must try to use an alternative.
-    - **Injection Point:** This reveals a weakness noted in the audit. The current logic in `Household.decide_and_consume` is likely hardcoded to specific goods. A refactoring would be needed to create a `good_utility_map` that could be dynamically adjusted based on price and availability, representing substitution.
-  - **Price Gouging vs. Price Smoothing (Firms):** Do firms with remaining supply exploit the shortage by raising prices astronomically, or do they smooth prices to maintain brand loyalty?
-    - **Injection Point:** In `Firm.make_decision`, the pricing logic for `SELL` orders could be modified to be more or less reactive to the supply/demand imbalance, potentially controlled by a firm's `Personality`.
-
-## 3. Implementation Strategy (Architectural Recommendations)
-
-This strategy is designed to introduce stress testing capabilities without exacerbating the existing architectural debt identified in the pre-flight audit.
-
-1.  **Introduce a `StressScenarioConfig` DTO:**
-    - Create a new, dedicated dataclass in `simulation/dtos/`. This object will hold all scenario-specific parameters.
-    - An instance of this DTO will be created by the `Simulation` initializer.
-    - **This avoids adding more unstructured `getattr` calls to the fragile `config_module`.**
-
-2.  **Explicit Parameter Passing (No God Object Modification):**
-    - The `StressScenarioConfig` object must be passed **explicitly** down the call stack.
-    - `Simulation.run_tick()` will pass it to `Household.make_decision()` and `Firm.make_decision()`.
-    - **DO NOT** make it a global or an attribute of the `Simulation` object that agents can access directly. This maintains clear data flow.
-
-3.  **Isolate Scenario Triggers:**
-    - The *triggers* for each scenario (e.g., the initial asset shock or productivity drop) should be implemented as a simple, self-contained `if self.time == SCENARIO_START_TICK:` block at the **top** of the `Simulation.run_tick()` method.
-    - This block reads from the `StressScenarioConfig` to activate the correct shock.
-    - **This contains the only modification to the `run_tick` monolith, keeping it minimal and predictable.**
-
-4.  **Agent-Level Behavioral Modification:**
-    - The actual *behavioral changes* during a scenario are implemented entirely within the agents' decision-making methods (`make_decision`).
-    - These methods will read the `StressScenarioConfig` DTO they receive as an argument and modify their logic accordingly (e.g., `if scenario_config.panic_selling_enabled:`).
-    - This respects the principle of agent autonomy and keeps complex conditional logic out of the `Simulation` engine.
-
-By following this strategy, we can introduce powerful stress-testing capabilities while promoting better architectural hygiene, ensuring that the new features are modular, testable, and do not add to the project's existing technical debt.

-### 🔍 Summary
-
-본 변경 사항은 구제금융(Bailout) 시스템의 계약(Covenant) 구조를 기존의 `Dict`에서 명시적인 `BailoutCovenant` 데이터 클래스로 리팩토링하여 코드의 타입 안정성과 명확성을 크게 향상했습니다. 또한, 구제금융 지급 로직에 대한 테스트 커버리지를 대폭 강화하여, 성공 시나리오뿐만 아니라 정부 자금 부족과 같은 실패 시나리오까지 검증합니다. 특히, 자금 이동의 정합성을 보장하기 위한 제로섬(Zero-Sum) 검증 테스트가 추가된 점이 인상적입니다.

----
-
-### ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
-
-- 발견된 사항 없음. 리팩토링과 함께 추가된 테스트 코드가 오히려 기존에 존재할 수 있었던 잠재적 논리 오류(자금 생성/소멸)를 명시적으로 검증하고 있어 시스템의 안정성을 높였습니다.

-
-### 💡 Suggestions
-
-- **테스트 로직 개선 (선택 사항)**: `tests/test_finance_bailout.py`의 `test_grant_bailout_loan_insufficient_government_funds` 함수 내에서 `mock_government.withdraw.side_effect`를 재정의하는 부분이 있습니다. 이는 기능적으로 문제가 없지만, 테스트의 일관성을 위해 `finance_test_environment` 픽스처의 `withdraw` 로직을 그대로 활용하고, 대신 테스트 시작(Arrange) 단계에서 `mock_government.assets`를 대출금액보다 낮은 값으로 설정하는 것이 더 간결한 접근일 수 있습니다. 이는 필수 수정 사항은 아니며, 코드 가독성에 대한 제안입니다.

-### ✅ Verdict
-
-**APPROVE**
-
-전반적으로 매우 훌륭한 변경입니다. 핵심 로직의 안정성을 높이는 리팩토링, 상세한 문서화, 그리고 무엇보다 자금 흐름의 무결성을 보장하는 견고한 테스트 케이스 추가까지 모범적인 Pull Request입니다. 즉시 병합해도 문제없을 것으로 판단됩니다.
