+## 10. Core Principles & Lessons
+
+### Principle: All Agents are Born with Purpose (Newborn Initialization)
+
+-   **Phenomenon**: Newborn agents were created but remained inactive, eventually being culled by the simulation for failing to act.
+-   **Cause**: Agents were initialized with an empty `initial_needs` dictionary (`{}`). The decision-making engine had no unmet needs to address, resulting in a permanent state of inaction (apathy).
+-   **Solution**: A default set of `NEWBORN_INITIAL_NEEDS` (e.g., for survival, social status) is now defined in `config/economy_params.yaml`. The `DemographicManager` injects these needs upon agent creation, providing an immediate set of goals.
+-   **Lesson**: An agent's existence requires not just physical attributes but also **intrinsic motivation**. Every agent must be initialized with a non-empty set of needs that drives their first actions. Without a goal, an agent is inert.

+# WO-121: Newborn Initialization Fix & Feedback Integration
+
+**Date:** 2026-05-25 (Simulation Time)
+**Author:** Jules
+**Status:** Completed
+
+## 1. Summary of Changes
+
+To address the "Dead on Arrival" newborn agent issue, we have:
+1.  **Configuration Centralization**: Externalized `NEWBORN_INITIAL_NEEDS` to `config/economy_params.yaml`. This allows tuning of newborn motivation without code changes.
+2.  **Logic Update**: Refactored `DemographicManager.process_births` to inject these configured needs into new `Household` agents, replacing the empty default.
+3.  **Documentation**: Added the "Principle: All Agents are Born with Purpose" to `AGENTS.md` to codify this architectural decision.
+4.  **Test Coverage**: Created `tests/systems/test_demographic_manager_newborn.py` to verify the fix in isolation.
+
+## 2. Technical Insights & Challenges
+
+### Mocking the Simulation "God Object"
+The `DemographicManager` is tightly coupled to the `Simulation` object, which made unit testing challenging. To test `process_births` in isolation, we had to mock:
+-   `simulation.next_agent_id`
+-   `simulation.time`
+-   `simulation.logger`
+-   `simulation.ai_trainer` (and its `get_engine` method)
+-   `simulation.markets` (specifically `loan_market`)
+-   `simulation.goods_data`
+-   `simulation.ai_training_manager` (as a class property)
+
+This confirms the high coupling risk identified in the audit. Future refactoring should consider injecting specific services (e.g., `IAITrainer`, `IMarketProvider`) instead of the entire `simulation` object.
+
+### Test Fixture Fragility
+We encountered an `AttributeError` in `SocialComponent` because the test fixture provided a string `"STABLE"` for personality, while the component expected a `Personality` Enum member. This highlights the importance of using typed Enums in test fixtures to match the strict typing of the codebase.
+
+### Regression in `verify_mitosis.py`
+While validating changes, we discovered that `tests/verification/verify_mitosis.py` was broken due to a recent refactor of the `Household` class (delegating assets to `EconComponent`). The test was attempting to modify `parent._assets` directly, which no longer affected the actual assets. We fixed this by targeting `parent.econ_component._assets`, ensuring the regression suite is green.
+
+## 3. Conclusion
+The fix is robust and verified. The newborn agents now start with intrinsic motivation (needs), preventing them from being culled due to inactivity. The testing ecosystem is slightly cleaner with the new isolated test, though the `Simulation` dependency remains a long-term architectural concern.
