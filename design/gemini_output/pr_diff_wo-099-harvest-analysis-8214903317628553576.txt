+# WO-099: Harvest Analysis & Refinement Report
+
+**Date**: 2026-01-21
+**Author**: Jules (AI Agent)
+**Status**: FAILED (Simulation Broken)
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+The investigation into the "Bumper Harvest" (Phase 23) failure reveals that the failure is **not** due to economic instability caused by excess supply (the expected "Harvest" problem), but rather a fundamental **Market Disconnect** where no transactions occur.
+
+The simulation resulted in **zero sales**, leading to the bankruptcy of all food firms and the starvation of the population. The "Bumper Harvest" never materialized because the market mechanism failed to clear a single unit of food.
+
+## 2. Key Metrics & Evidence
+
+Data collected from `harvest_data.csv` (500 Ticks):
+
+| Metric | Result | Implication |
+|---|---|---|
+| **Total Sales Volume** | **0.00** | **CRITICAL FAILURE**. No goods changed hands. |
+| **Food Price** | 5.00 -> 5.00 (Flat) | No price discovery occurred. |
+| **Population** | 60 -> 20 (-66%) | Mass starvation due to inability to buy food. |
+| **Active Food Firms** | 100% -> 0% | All firms went bankrupt due to 0 revenue. |
+| **Total Inventory** | Peaked ~1462, then 0 | Firms produced, couldn't sell, then died. |
+
+## 3. Failure Dynamics
+
+1.  **Production Starts:** Firms successfully produced food in the early ticks (Inventory rose to 1462).
+2.  **Market Freeze:** Despite firms having inventory and households having cash (initial 10,000), **no matching occurred**.
+    *   *Hypothesis:* Firms posted Asks, but Households did not post Bids (or vice versa), or they posted to different market IDs (e.g., `basic_food` vs `food`).
+3.  **Production Halt:** Firms reached inventory caps (unsold goods) and stopped production.
+4.  **Insolvency:**
+    *   **Firms:** Incurred holding costs and maintenance fees with 0 revenue. Assets drained -> Bankruptcy.
+    *   **Households:** Could not satisfy survival needs (Food). Starvation -> Death.
+
+## 4. Root Cause Hypothesis
+
+The failure is technical, not economic.
+
+*   **Suspect A (Household Engine):** The `RuleBasedHouseholdDecisionEngine` may not be correctly configured to map the need `survival` to the specific good `basic_food`. If it tries to buy generic `food` or fails to generate a Bid, the market is empty.
+*   **Suspect B (Market Routing):** The `EconomyManager` or `Market` system may have a mismatch between the Good ID (`basic_food`) and the Market ID.
+
+## 5. Recommendations for Refinement
+
+1.  **Debug Order Generation:** Inspect `RuleBasedHouseholdDecisionEngine.decide_purchases` to ensure it generates Bids for `basic_food`.
+2.  **Verify Market Keys:** Ensure `sim.markets` uses the exact same keys as the Agents' `specialization` and `goods_data`.
+3.  **Force Trade Test:** Create a unit test where 1 Firm and 1 Household are forced to trade `basic_food` to verify the pipeline.
