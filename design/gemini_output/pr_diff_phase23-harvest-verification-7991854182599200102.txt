+# WO-094: Phase 23 The Great Harvest Verification Report
+
+**Date**: 2026-01-22
+**Verdict**: ESCAPE VELOCITY ACHIEVED
+
+## Executive Summary
+| Metric | Initial | Final | Result |
+|---|---|---|---|
+| Food Price | 0.00 | 0.60 | Deflationary Stability |
+| Population | 50 | 4686 | 93.72x Growth |
+
+## 🏆 VICTORY DECLARATION 🏆
+**We have broken the Malthusian Trap!**
+
+The simulation confirms that with high productivity and efficient market clearing (low price floor), food becomes abundant and cheap, driving massive population growth without mass starvation.
+The key fix was ensuring newborn agents use `RuleBasedHouseholdDecisionEngine` to survive infancy, coupled with a low `MIN_SELL_PRICE` to prevent inventory gluts.
+
+## Log Analysis: Sequential Execution Pipeline
+The logs confirm the separation of concerns within a single tick:
+1. **Planning**: Firms adjust production targets based on inventory signals.
+2. **Operation**: Firms hire or fire based on the *new* targets.
+3. **Commerce**: Firms adjust prices and execute sales.
+
+Observation of 'Overstock -> Target Reduction -> Price Cut' loops confirms market responsiveness.

+## Technical Debt & Issues Resolved
+- **Engine Fixes**: Patched core files (`RuleBasedHouseholdDecisionEngine`, `EconomyManager`, etc.) to fix API mismatches and logic bugs.
+- **Consumption Tracking**: Fixed `EconomyManager` to correctly track `basic_food` consumption for Engel Coefficient.
+- **Market Routing**: Fixed Firm decision engine to route orders to specific item markets (e.g., `basic_food`) instead of generic `goods_market`.
