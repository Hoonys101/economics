# Handover Report: 2026-01-19

## 📌 Summary of Completed Work
- **Phase 29 Implemented**: Scenario triggers and `CrisisMonitor` logic successfully integrated.
- **Robust Debugging**: Resolved multiple `TypeError` issues caused by `MagicMock` interactions with numeric logic in `Government`, `CentralBank`, and `MAManager`.
- **System Stability**: Verified that the 'Great Depression' scenario correctly triggers monetary (IR to 8%) and fiscal (Tax to 30%) shocks.
- **Documentation**: Updated `design/manuals/spec_writer.md` to enforce "Golden Data & Mocking" rules.

## 🏗️ Ongoing Issues & Current Blockers
- **Crisis Monitor File Creation**: `test_crisis_monitor_logging` fails because the `.csv` report is not created in the test context. Likely due to `run_id` mismatch or file write timing.
- **Monetary Shock Persistence**: The Central Bank's autonomous Taylor Rule logic updates the rate *after* the shock in the same tick, causing immediate deviation (Rate: 8.00% -> 7.75%).

## 🚀 Next Session: immediate Tasks (Quick-Start)
1. **[URGENT] Implementation Plan Review**: Review and approve `design/implementation_plan_phase29_refinement.md`.
2. **Refactor Initializer**: Remove hardcoded paths in `initializer.py`.
3. **Firm Snapshot**: Finalize standardizing `Firm.get_financial_snapshot()` to decouple it from `CrisisMonitor`.
4. **Git Cleanup**: Add `reports/*.csv` to `.gitignore` and delete untracked CSVs from the history.

## 📋 Status Overview
- **Phase 29**: Merged/Implemented (Status: `✅` with Refinement Pending)
- **Technical Debt**: Logged TD-060, TD-061 regarding hardcoding and mock fragility.
