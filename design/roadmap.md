## 🔮 Phase 21+: The Future Visions (Long-Term)

### Vision A: The Political Animal (Politics & Democracy)
- **Goal**: Introduce Voting Power and Democracy.
- **Scenario**: 
    - Renters vote for Rent Control & Subsidies.
    - Owners vote for Tax Cuts & Asset Protection.
    - Simulation of Gerontocracy (Rule of the Old) vs Youth Disenchantment.

### Vision B: Corporate Empires (Corporate AI Adoption) ⭐ **[NEXT PHASE]**
- **Goal**: Upgrade Firms to Active AI Agents.
- **Scenario**:
    - Firms invest in Automation to combat Labor Scarcity (Phase 20 result).
    - Resulting Unemployment vs Productivity Gains.
    - Rise of Monopolies and "Too Big To Fail".
- **Status**: 🏗️ Planning

### Vision C: The Central Bank (Macro Control Tower)

    - User (President/Governor) sets Interest Rates & Tax Policy.
    - AI-based Policy Optimization (RL Government).

## 🧠 **[CORE PHILOSOPHY] Rule-Based → Adaptive AI Migration**
> **Goal**: 모든 하드코딩된 규칙 기반 로직을 학습 기반 또는 적응형 시스템으로 전환
> **Rationale**: 본 프로젝트의 핵심 철학 - 에이전트는 "프로그래밍된 대로" 행동하는 것이 아니라 "경험에서 학습"해야 함

### 현재 Rule-Based 부채 (Technical Debt)
| Component | 현재 상태 | 목표 상태 |
|---|---|---|
| `ActionProposalEngine` | 조건문 기반 행동 제안 | RL Policy Network |
| `CorporateManager` | 휴리스틱 고용/해고 | Firm System 2 NPV 최적화 |
| `HousingManager` | NPV 임계값 하드코딩 | 학습된 선호도 |
| `PortfolioManager` | Value/Momentum 규칙 | Multi-Factor Learning |
| `DemographicManager` | 조건부 출산 로직 | 적응형 r/K 전략 |
| `Government.calculate_*` | 고정 세율 공식 | 정책 최적화 RL |

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase A**: 규칙을 "Default Policy"로 유지하면서 학습 레이어 추가
2. **Phase B**: 학습된 정책이 규칙을 점진적으로 대체
3. **Phase C**: 규칙 완전 제거 (Pure AI)

- [ ] 21. **Config Refactoring Pass 2**: 런타임 조정 시스템 (CLI/API 연동)

## ⚠️ [MAJOR OVERHAUL REQUIRED] Cognitive Architecture (Phase 20+)
> **Goal**: System 1 (Fast/RL) + System 2 (Slow/Planner) 분리
> **Trigger**: 부동산/연금 등 초장기 결정이 필요한 기능 확장 시
> **Reference**: Kahneman's Dual-Process Theory

- **Current State**: RL(Q-Learning)은 단기 보상에만 반응 (근시안적).
- **Future State**: Model-Based Planning을 통해 미래 시나리오를 시뮬레이션하고 현재 행동을 제약.
- **Interim Solution**: Phase 17-3에서는 `HousingManager`가 NPV 계산으로 대리 수행.

## 🟣 Architecture v3.0: High-Performance Simulation (Long-Term)
> **Goal**: Optimization Strategy for 100k+ Agents (OOP -> DOP Transition)
> **Advisor**: Architect Prime

### 1. Philosophy: OOP to DOP (Data-Oriented Programming)
- **Problem**: `for agent in agents: agent.step()` is the bottleneck due to Python overhead and cache misses.
- **Solution**: Maximizing SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and vectorized operations.

### 2. Implementation Stages
#### Stage 1: JIT Compilation (Low Effort, High Gain)
- **Action**: Apply `@numba.jit` to math-heavy functions (utility calc, tax calc).
- **Benefit**: 10x~50x speedup for computational hotspots without structural changes.

#### Stage 2: Profiling & Vectorized Decisions (The "Think" Layer)
- **Action**: Profile via `cProfile` to find bottlenecks.
- **Action**: Convert agent decision logic (Labor, Consumption) to **Vectorized Operations** using NumPy/Pandas.
    ```python
    # Example: Vectorized Labor Decision
    labor_supply = np.where(assets > threshold, 0, 8)
    ```
- **Benefit**: 100x speedup for decision phase (Parallelizable).

#### Stage 3: Batch Transaction Matching (The "Act" Layer)
- **Problem**: Sequential transactions handling resource contention.
- **Solution**: **Batch Matching** via Matrix Operations.
    - Construct `Demand Matrix` and `Supply Matrix`.
    - Use Linear Algebra (MatMul) to calculate utility scores.
    - Resolve contention via Pro-rata or Random Vectorized choices.

#### Stage 4: Entity Component System (ECS) (Final Form)
- **Action**: Replace Agent Classes with a monolithic **DataFrame/Database** (State Table).
- **Reference**: Standard pattern in Game Development (Data-Driven Design).
