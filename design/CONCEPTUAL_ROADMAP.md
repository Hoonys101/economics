# Conceptual Roadmap: The Evolution of Society

This roadmap tracks the transition of our simulation from a simple economic engine to a complex, emergent society.

## 🗺️ Execution Waves

### [Wave 3: Heterogeneous Market Revolution (Active)](file:///c:/coding/economics/design/blueprints/wave3_heterogeneous_market.md)
*   **Theme:** Information Asymmetry & The Education Bubble.
*   **Key Pillar:** Nash Bargaining, Halo Effects, and Envy-driven major selection.

### [Wave 4: Social & Health Dynamics (Planning)](file:///c:/coding/economics/design/blueprints/wave4_social_health.md)
*   **Theme:** Biological Risks & Social Scaling.
*   **Key Pillar:** Marriage Markets (Household M&A) and Health Shocks (Precautionary Saving).

### [Wave 5: Political Economy & Identity (Conceptual)](file:///c:/coding/economics/design/blueprints/wave5_politics_identity.md)
*   **Theme:** The Power of Self-Esteem & Rent-Seeking.
*   **Key Pillar:** Identity Utility ($U_{id}$) and the Political Orchestrator (Voting/Lobbying).
