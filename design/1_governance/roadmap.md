## 🧠 **[CORE PHILOSOPHY] Rule-Based → Adaptive AI Migration**
> **Goal**: 모든 하드코딩된 규칙 기반 로직을 학습 기반 또는 적응형 시스템으로 전환
> **Rationale**: 본 프로젝트의 핵심 철학 - 에이전트는 "프로그래밍된 대로" 행동하는 것이 아니라 "경험에서 학습"해야 함

### ⚠️ Architect Prime Diagnosis: The Asymmetry of Intelligence
> **현재 경제 붕괴 원인:** 지능의 비대칭 (Asymmetry)

| Agent | Intelligence Level | 결과 |
|---|---|---|
| **Corporate (Capital)** | System 2 (AI/Optimization) ✅ | 노동 비용 0으로 최적화 |
| **Government/Labor** | Rule-Based (Fixed) ❌ | AI 기업 통제 불가 |

→ **"똑똑한 악당(기업)"과 "멍청한 경찰(정부)"의 싸움** = 디스토피아 필연

### 현재 Rule-Based 부채 (Technical Debt)
| Component | 현재 상태 | 목표 상태 |
|---|---|---|
| `ActionProposalEngine` | 조건문 기반 행동 제안 | RL Policy Network |
| `CorporateManager` | 휴리스틱 고용/해고 | Firm System 2 NPV 최적화 |
| `HousingManager` | NPV 임계값 하드코딩 | 학습된 선호도 |
| `PortfolioManager` | Value/Momentum 규칙 | Multi-Factor Learning |
| `DemographicManager` | 조건부 출산 로직 | 적응형 r/K 전략 |
| `Government.calculate_*` | 고정 세율 공식 | 정책 최적화 RL |

### Migration Strategy (3-Phase)
```
Phase A (Current): Rule-Based 가드레일로 AI 폭주 통제
 └─ LABOR_ELASTICITY_MIN, AUTOMATION_TAX 등 하드 제약
Phase B (Next): 학습된 정책이 규칙을 점진적 대체
 └─ RL Government가 세율/규제를 동적 조정
Phase C (Target): 규칙 완전 제거 (Pure AI Ecosystem)
 └─ 모든 에이전트가 학습 기반
```

### Phase A 가드레일 (/044)
| Guardrail | 기능 | 파라미터 |
|---|---|---|
| **노동 분배율 하한** | AI가 α < X% 만들지 못함 | `LABOR_ELASTICITY_MIN = 0.3` |
| **자동화세** | 자동화 비용 기하급수 증가 | `AUTOMATION_TAX_RATE` |
| **해고 비용** | 대량 해고 시 퇴직금 강제 | `SEVERANCE_PAY_WEEKS` |
| **최저 임금 연동** | 생산성 상승 시 임금도 상승 | `MIN_WAGE_PRODUCTIVITY_LINK` |



- [ ] 21. **Config Refactoring Pass 2**: 런타임 조정 시스템 (CLI/API 연동)

## ⚠️ [MAJOR OVERHAUL REQUIRED] Cognitive Architecture (Phase 20+)
> **Goal**: System 1 (Fast/RL) + System 2 (Slow/Planner) 분리
> **Trigger**: 부동산/연금 등 초장기 결정이 필요한 기능 확장 시
> **Reference**: Kahneman's Dual-Process Theory

- **Current State**: RL(Q-Learning)은 단기 보상에만 반응 (근시안적).
- **Future State**: Model-Based Planning을 통해 미래 시나리오를 시뮬레이션하고 현재 행동을 제약.
- **Interim Solution**: Phase 17-3에서는 `HousingManager`가 NPV 계산으로 대리 수행.

## 🟣 Architecture v3.0: High-Performance Simulation (Long-Term)
> **Goal**: Optimization Strategy for 100k+ Agents (OOP -> DOP Transition)
> **Advisor**: Architect Prime

### 1. Philosophy: OOP to DOP (Data-Oriented Programming)
- **Problem**: `for agent in agents: agent.step()` is the bottleneck due to Python overhead and cache misses.
- **Solution**: Maximizing SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and vectorized operations.

### 2. Implementation Stages
#### Stage 1: JIT Compilation (Low Effort, High Gain)
- **Action**: Apply `@numba.jit` to math-heavy functions (utility calc, tax calc).
- **Benefit**: 10x~50x speedup for computational hotspots without structural changes.

#### Stage 2: Profiling & Vectorized Decisions (The "Think" Layer)
- **Action**: Profile via `cProfile` to find bottlenecks.
- **Action**: Convert agent decision logic (Labor, Consumption) to **Vectorized Operations** using NumPy/Pandas.
 ```python
 # Example: Vectorized Labor Decision
 labor_supply = np.where(assets > threshold, 0, 8)
 ```
- **Benefit**: 100x speedup for decision phase (Parallelizable).

#### Stage 3: Batch Transaction Matching (The "Act" Layer)
- **Problem**: Sequential transactions handling resource contention.
- **Solution**: **Batch Matching** via Matrix Operations.
 - Construct `Demand Matrix` and `Supply Matrix`.
 - Use Linear Algebra (MatMul) to calculate utility scores.
 - Resolve contention via Pro-rata or Random Vectorized choices.

#### Stage 4: Entity Component System (ECS) (Final Form)
- **Action**: Replace Agent Classes with a monolithic **DataFrame/Database** (State Table).
- **Reference**: Standard pattern in Game Development (Data-Driven Design).
