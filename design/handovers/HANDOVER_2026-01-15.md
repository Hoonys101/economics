# Daily Handover Report (2026-01-15)

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Primary Achievement**: `git-go.bat` transformation into an AI-powered Code Reviewer.
    - Implemented `scripts/git_sync_checker.py` (Fixed remote HEAD tracking).
    - Added `GitReviewer` persona (Specialized in Diff Analysis & Security Audit).
- **Current Active Task**: `WO-072: Sovereign Debt & Financial Credit`.
    - Jules has implemented the core `FinanceSystem` (Bonds, Loans).
    - **Current Status**: **Review Rejected** due to Critical Money Leak.

## 2. Critical Blockers (Zero-Sum Violations)
The following issues must be resolved before merging `jules/sovereign-debt-wip`:
1.  **Debt Service Leak**: Interest payments were disappearing (not deducted from Gov assets).
2.  **QE Leak**: Central Bank was buying bonds without asset deduction (Money printer go brrr defect).
*Status*: Jules has been notified and is working on the fix.

## 3. Structural & Documentation Updates
The project context is fully synchronized across these 5 key documents:

| Document | Purpose | Status Update |
|---|---|---|
| `design/project_status.md` | Phase Status | Updated to Phase 26.5 (In Progress) |
| `design/roadmap.md` | Future Plans | WO-072 marked as [ACTIVE] |
| `design/structure.md` | Architecture | Added Finance System context implicitly |
| `design/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md` | Debt Tracking | 11 Hardcoded debts Deferred via Audit |
| `design/TEAM_LEADER_HANDBOOK.md`| Workflow | Updated Git Review Process |

### ⚠️ Documentation Consistency Note
- **Audit Result**: `doc_consistency_check.md` confirmed TD-024 status alignment (Fixed).
- **Update Completed**: `design/structure.md` has been updated to **v4.0** (The Living World Update), fully reflecting the current codebase including Housing, Tech, and Finance systems.
    - **Action for Next Session**: None regarding documentation. Focus on WO-072 Code Fix.

## 4. Next Session Action Plan
1.  **Await Jules PR**: Monitor for the fix on WO-072.
2.  **Rerun Review**: Execute `.\git-go.bat` to verify Money Leak and Test fixes.
3.  **Merge & Verify**: Upon passing, merge to `main` and proceed to WO-073 (Corporate Debt).
