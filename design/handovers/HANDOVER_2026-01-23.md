# Handover Report: 2026-01-23

## 1. Session Summary
This session focused on restoring the economic and accounting integrity of the simulation. We successfully transitioned from direct asset mutation to a centralized, atomic `SettlementSystem`. We also implemented a robust sovereign debt and corporate tax pipeline.

## 2. Key Achievements
- **Economic Purity (WO-112)**: 
    - Implemented `SettlementSystem` to enforce the Zero-Sum principle.
    - Encapsulated agent assets (`_assets`) to prevent direct mutation.
    - Resolved **TD-101** (Shadow Economy) and **TD-102** (Residual Evaporation).
- **Sovereign Debt & Corporate Finance (WO-113)**:
    - Implemented `FinanceSystem` for atomic bond issuance and tax collection.
    - Introduced `FiscalMonitor` to track government debt-to-GDP ratio.
    - Resolved **TD-104** (Bank Interface Ghosting).
- **Architecture & Planning**:
    - Generated a comprehensive spec for `TD-103` (DTO Purity Gate).
    - Aborted the C++ Native Agent DLL path (**TD-105**) due to system environment constraints.

## 3. Repayment Plan Status: "The Great Reset"
- **Step 1: Purity Guard** ✅ **COMPLETED** (SettlementSystem)
- **Step 2: Abstraction Wall** ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** (DTO Purity Gate spec ready)
- **Step 3: Formal Registry** ✅ **COMPLETED** (Financial Protocols implemented)

## 4. Pending Tasks & Risks
- **TD-103 (Abstraction Wall)**: AI Engines still receive `self` (agent instance) in some places. The refactoring plan is ready but needs implementation.
- **Verification**: While unit tests for the new systems passed, a long-run stress test (1,000+ ticks) using the new fiscal logic is recommended.
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Some legacy code might still attempt to use `_add_assets` or `_sub_assets` directly. Continued surveillance of logs for "ATOMICITY_FAILURE" is necessary.

## 5. Next Session Directive
- Proceed with **Step 2 (Abstraction Wall)** by implementing the `DTO_PURITY_GATE_SPEC.md`.
- Focus on refactoring `RuleBasedHouseholdDecisionEngine` and the `DecisionContext` creation logic in `core_agents.py`.
- Conduct a "Great Reset" verification run to confirm long-term fiscal stability with the new bond issuance logic.

**Status:** Session Closed. Ready for next sprint.
