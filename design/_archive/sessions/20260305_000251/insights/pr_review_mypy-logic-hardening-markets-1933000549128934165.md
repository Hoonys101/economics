# Code Review Report

## 🔍 1. Summary
The PR successfully refactors `HousingTransactionHandler` to enforce the "Penny Standard" (strict integer arithmetic) and resolves protocol drift in `IBankService`. It correctly maintains financial integrity (Zero-Sum) by deriving the down payment via subtraction (`sale_price - loan_amount`) and ensuring all bank transfers explicitly use integer types. A robust test file with proper assertions on data types and call counts has been added.

## 🚨 2. Critical Issues
*   **None found.** No hardcoded API keys, paths, or external URLs exist.
*   Zero-Sum is rigorously maintained across the complex Escrow/Bank saga.

## ⚠️ 3. Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Mock Purity (Test Hygiene)**: In `tests/market/test_housing_transaction_handler.py`, a `MagicMock` is used in place of a DTO:
    ```python
    bank.get_debt_status.return_value = MagicMock(next_payment_pennies=0, total_outstanding_pennies=0)
    ```
    According to `TESTING_STABILITY.md`, DTOs should be instantiated directly rather than mocked. This prevents type errors if DTO internal logic is ever updated.

## 💡 4. Suggestions
*   **Test Data Realism**: In `_create_borrower_profile`, `gross_income_pennies` is calculated as `buyer.current_wage * work_hours * ticks_per_month`. In the test, `MockBuyer._current_wage` is set to `500000` (5,000 USD). If `current_wage` represents an hourly rate, a $5k/hr wage produces an extreme gross income. While logically safe for the current test, it's recommended to align test fixture values closer to the economic configuration's expected baseline.
*   **DTO Instantiation in Tests**: Refactor the mock return value to use the actual `DebtStatusDTO`:
    ```python
    from modules.finance.dtos import DebtStatusDTO
    # ...
    bank.get_debt_status.return_value = DebtStatusDTO(total_outstanding_pennies=0, next_payment_pennies=0, ...)
    ```

## 🧠 5. Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**:
    > "A significant drift was identified between `IBankService` (Protocol) and its implementation/usage. The `grant_loan` method signature in the protocol did not include `borrower_profile`, yet `HousingTransactionHandler` was passing it. This was resolved by updating the `IBankService` protocol..."
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: **EXCELLENT**. The insight correctly pinpoints "Protocol Drift"—a systemic risk where abstract interfaces fall behind their concrete implementations, defeating the purpose of static analysis. Fixing this at the `Protocol` level, rather than silencing Mypy via `Any` casting, sets a high standard for type safety. The insight structure is highly valuable, though we recommend maintaining the strict `현상/원인/해결/교훈` headers for uniformity.

## 📚 6. Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
*   **Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`
*   **Draft Content**:
```markdown
### [Resolved] Protocol Drift in Financial Interfaces
- **현상 (Symptom)**: Handlers (`HousingTransactionHandler`) were passing arguments (`borrower_profile`) to Bank Services that were not defined in the `IBankService` Protocol, leading to Mypy enforcement failures.
- **원인 (Cause)**: Feature expansions in concrete Engine classes (e.g., Credit Assessment) outpaced updates to the shared `api.py` abstract Protocols.
- **해결 (Solution)**: Updated `IBankService.grant_loan` to explicitly include `Optional[BorrowerProfileDTO]`.
- **교훈 (Lesson Learned)**: Protocols must dictate the contract. When extending functionality that requires new contextual data, the `api.py` Protocol must be updated first, treating the Protocol as the absolute Single Source of Truth for inter-module communication.
```

## ✅ 7. Verdict
**APPROVE**
The changes are mathematically sound, safely orchestrated via Saga patterns, and correctly address strict typing without compromising the financial integrity of the simulation. Please apply the minor test mock suggestions in a future cleanup.
