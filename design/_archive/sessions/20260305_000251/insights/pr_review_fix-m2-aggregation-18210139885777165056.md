# 🐙 Gemini-CLI Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
The PR successfully resolves the "Negative Inversion" and "Ghost Agents" bugs by refactoring `calculate_total_money` to iterate `self.agents.values()`, separating positive balances (M2) from negative balances (System Debt), and enforcing type safety via `MoneySupplyDTO`.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*None.* The implementation correctly eliminates the `0.00` M2 calculation issue. No security violations, money-duplication logic errors, or hardcoded magic numbers were detected.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
- **Unmasked Money Leak Warning**: By fixing the M2 calculation, the `diagnostic_refined.md` logs now reveal a massive discrepancy between `Current` and `Expected` money supply (e.g., `Tick 1 | Current: 155210235.00, Expected: 52250235.00, Delta: 102960000.0000`). This indicates that while the aggregation is now correct, the *tracking* of authorized injections (e.g., `baseline_money_supply` updates or `government.get_monetary_delta()`) is missing significant money creation events (likely Commercial Bank Loans or CB LLR injections). This should be the target of the next diagnostic wave.
- **Dead Agent Money Vanishing**: In `simulation/world_state.py`, `if hasattr(agent, 'is_active') and not agent.is_active: continue` excludes inactive agents. If a bankrupt firm or dead household has non-zero balances that haven't been properly escheatmented, their money mathematically disappears from the M2/Debt calculation, violating strict Zero-Sum integrity. This is a preexisting logic gap but worth tracking.

## 💡 Suggestions
- To fix the unmasked `MONEY_SUPPLY_CHECK` delta, expand the tracking of `expected_money` in `TickOrchestrator._finalize_tick` to include Central Bank direct injections and Commercial Bank credit expansion. Currently, it only adds `government.get_monetary_delta()`.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
- **Original Insight**: 
  > The "Negative Inversion" bug was rooted in two issues: 1. Naive Aggregation... 2. Ghost Agents: The `currency_holders` list in `WorldState` was not being reliably populated... Solution Architecture: Atomic M2 Definition... Robust Iteration... DTO Enforcement. The audit confirmed that M2 (155M) - SystemDebt (145M) = 10M...
- **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight is excellent. It correctly identifies the dual root causes (math cancellation and broken state reference). The migration to a strict `MoneySupplyDTO` is a very strong architectural improvement that prevents ad-hoc dictionary handling. The Zero-Sum Audit noted at the end (`M2 (155M) - SystemDebt (145M) = 10M`) perfectly demonstrates why separating Debt from M2 is required to understand system net equity.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
- **Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/ECONOMIC_INSIGHTS.md`
- **Draft Content**:
```markdown
### Insight: M2 Aggregation, System Debt, and Ghost Agents
- **현상 (Symptom)**: The Money Supply (M2) check constantly reported `Current: 0.00` or drastically undervalued the money supply.
- **원인 (Root Cause)**: 
  1. **Ghost Agents**: The `currency_holders` list was not reliably populated during initialization, causing the aggregator to skip agents.
  2. **Negative Inversion (Naive Aggregation)**: System agents (Central Bank, Government) often carry large negative balances (representing fiat injection). Naively summing all balances caused these negative values to algebraically cancel out the positive balances of the public, masking the true M2.
- **해결 (Solution)**: 
  - Abandoned `currency_holders` in favor of iterating `self.agents.values()` as the Single Source of Truth.
  - Separated the aggregation logic: strictly summing positive balances as `M2` (Circulating Supply) and absolute negative balances as `System Debt`.
  - Introduced `MoneySupplyDTO` to formalize the return structure and enforce penny-standard type safety.
- **교훈 (Lesson)**: When aggregating macroscopic economic indicators, always consider the algebraic sign of System Agents' ledgers. Money supply must be measured by the positive holdings of the public, while systemic deficits should be tracked as a separate "System Debt" metric to maintain strict Zero-Sum visibility.
