# Code Review Report

## 1. 🔍 Summary
Consolidated the fragmented `IGovernment` protocol definitions into a Single Source of Truth (`modules/government/api.py`). The new protocol strictly enforces the Penny Standard (returning `int` or `Dict[CurrencyCode, int]`) for all financial properties, and `FiscalMonitor` / `StormVerifier` were successfully adapted to convert these penny values to dollars for accurate GDP ratio calculations.

## 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   **None Found.** No security violations, hardcoded paths, or Zero-Sum Integrity breaches were detected.

## 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **None Found.** The transition from `float` to `int` properties within the `IGovernment` facade was correctly handled in consuming analysis modules by aggregating dictionary values and dividing by `100.0` to maintain consistency with `gdp` comparisons. 

## 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Remove Debug File:** The file `debug_mock_protocol.py` is included in the PR diff. This appears to be a local scratchpad script used to investigate the `MagicMock` protocol issue. It is recommended to remove this file to maintain repository cleanliness.

## 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: 
    > **Mocking Complexity**: `MagicMock` with `spec=Protocol` (runtime checkable) proved tricky in tests. `MagicMock(spec=Class)` failed `isinstance(mock, Protocol)` checks because instance attributes were missing from the class spec. The solution was to use `MagicMock()` without spec but manually populate all required protocol attributes (`id`, `name`, `is_active`, etc.).
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: Excellent and highly accurate insight. This identifies a well-known but frustrating edge case in Python's `unittest.mock` when interacting with `@runtime_checkable` Protocols. Because `spec=Class` only attaches class-level attributes to the mock, instance-level fields defined in the Protocol are missing, causing `isinstance()` checks in the application code to fail. Documenting this workaround (using a spec-less mock and manually injecting attributes) will save significant debugging time for future test development.

## 6. 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

### ⚠️ Mocking `@runtime_checkable` Protocols

When writing tests for components that verify dependencies using `isinstance(obj, MyProtocol)` (where `MyProtocol` is decorated with `@runtime_checkable`), be cautious when using `MagicMock(spec=MyConcreteClass)`.

**The Problem:**
`MagicMock(spec=Class)` only populates the mock with attributes defined at the *class* level. Instance attributes (like those defined in an `__init__` or simply as type hints in the Protocol) are omitted. This causes the `isinstance` check to fail at runtime because the mock object lacks the required Protocol attributes.

**The Solution:**
Avoid using `spec=` for strict Protocol compliance checks. Instead, instantiate a standard `MagicMock()` and manually assign all the attributes explicitly required by the Protocol.

```python
# ❌ BAD: isinstance(mock_gov, IGovernment) will FAIL if properties are missing
sim.world_state.government = MagicMock(spec=Government) 

# ✅ GOOD: Satisfies runtime_checkable Protocol
mock_gov = MagicMock()
mock_gov.id = 1
mock_gov.name = "Gov"
mock_gov.is_active = True
mock_gov.total_debt = 0
# ... [assign other required protocol fields] ...
sim.world_state.government = mock_gov
```
```
