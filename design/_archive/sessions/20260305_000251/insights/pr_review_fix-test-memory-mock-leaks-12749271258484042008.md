# Code Review Report

1.  **🔍 Summary**: 
    The PR addresses test suite memory leaks and crashes by introducing a `MockRegistry` (backed by `weakref.WeakSet`) to track and reset mocks, replacing expensive global `gc.get_objects()` sweeps. It also replaces a brittle `weakref.proxy` in `FinanceSystem` with an explicit `weakref.ref` property, and tightens configuration isolation in tests by raising explicit errors when mocks leak into `GlobalConfig`.

2.  **🚨 Critical Issues**: 
    None found. Zero-Sum integrity, SSOT principles, and security guidelines are maintained.

3.  **⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps**: 
    None. The implementation cleanly handles the object graph without polluting domain logic.

4.  **💡 Suggestions**: 
    *   **PatchWrapper Caution**: The `PatchWrapper` for `unittest.mock.patch` is an elegant proxy pattern to avoid breaking `pytest-mock`. However, global monkeypatching of the standard library can be fragile across Python version upgrades. Long-term, prefer utilizing `pytest-mock`'s built-in fixtures (`mocker`) exclusively across the codebase, which natively handles lifecycle and cleanup without custom registry overhead.

5.  **🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation**:
    *   **Original Insight**: 
        > - **MockRegistry Implementation**: Replaced the global `gc.get_objects()` mock sweep with a `MockRegistry` utilizing `weakref.WeakSet()`. Hooked `unittest.mock.patch` using an object proxy `PatchWrapper` to avoid `pytest-mock` breakage.
        > - **Weakref Stability**: Migrated `FinanceSystem.government` from a brittle `weakref.proxy` to an explicit `weakref.ref` paired with an ` @property` getter raising a `ReferenceError` when the target is collected. Updated test fixtures correctly.
        > - **StrictConfigWrapper**: Updated the scenario runner to prevent mock poisoning using a `StrictConfigWrapper`, actively preventing base config leaks while explicitly setting overrides for missing global vars.
    *   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight is technically deep and precise. Recognizing that entirely overwriting `unittest.mock.patch` breaks `pytest-mock` due to missing attributes is a high-value operational lesson. Moving from `weakref.proxy` to `weakref.ref` with a property is also a definitive architectural improvement for explicit failure modes over mysterious segmentation faults or silent propagation. 

6.  **📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)**: 
    *   **Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`
    *   **Draft Content**:
        ```markdown
        ### Mock Lifecycle & pytest-mock Compatibility (STABILIZATION_PHASE_1)
        *   **Context**: Global test memory sweeps using `gc.get_objects()` are computationally expensive and unstable.
        *   **Insight**: Tracking mocks requires intercepting `unittest.mock.patch`. However, completely overwriting `patch` breaks `pytest-mock`, which relies on accessing attributes of the original patch object.
        *   **Resolution**: Use a proxy class (`PatchWrapper`) that overrides `__call__` while delegating `__getattr__` to the original patch. Track instantiated mocks via `weakref.WeakSet` to reset them in `pytest_runtest_teardown` without blocking GC.
        *   **Weakref Standard**: Prefer explicit `weakref.ref()` wrapped in a `@property` (which explicitly raises `ReferenceError` on collection) over `weakref.proxy()`, which can fail obscurely during test teardown.
        ```
