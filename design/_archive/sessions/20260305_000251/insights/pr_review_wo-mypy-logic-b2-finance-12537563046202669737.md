# Code Review Report

## 1. 🔍 Summary
- **Dependency Inversion**: Successfully resolved a circular import dependency involving `IAgent` by relocating its definition from the Simulation layer to the Foundation layer (`modules/system/api.py`).
- **Penny Standard Enforcement**: Replaced lingering float initializations and casts (`0.0`, `float()`) with strict integer values in `TransactionProcessor` and added runtime float-guards in `CentralBank`.
- **Protocol Alignment**: Updated the `IBankService` protocol (`grant_loan`) to correctly reflect the implementation signature, ensuring Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) compliance.

## 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
- **None**. The strict integer casting directly mitigates potential floating-point errors, enhancing financial integrity. No security vulnerabilities or hardcoded paths were found.

## 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
- **WAC Truncation vs. Rounding (`simulation/portfolio.py`)**: 
  The diff shows `share.acquisition_price = int(total_cost / total_qty)`. Using `int()` directly truncates the float value towards zero. While `acquisition_price` is an internal tracking metric and doesn't directly break the zero-sum ledger, repeated truncation can cause a downward drift in Weighted Average Cost (WAC) calculations over high-frequency trading. 
  *(Note: The full file context provided shows that `int(round(...))` may have already been applied in the final file, but the diff explicitly shows `int()`. Ensure rounding is preferred over truncation for WAC).*

## 4. 💡 Suggestions
- **Robust Type Guards (`simulation/agents/central_bank.py`)**:
  Currently, `if isinstance(amount, float):` is used to guard against floats. However, this does not prevent strings, dictionaries, or other unexpected types from being passed. A positive guard like `if not isinstance(amount, int) or isinstance(amount, bool):` is much safer for strict financial APIs (noting that `bool` is a subclass of `int` in Python).

## 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
- **Original Insight**: 
  > *The `modules/system/api.py` file (Foundation Layer) was importing `IAgent` from `modules/simulation/api.py` (Simulation Layer), which in turn imported `ISettlementSystem` from `simulation/finance/api.py`, which imported `modules/system/api.py` for `CurrencyCode`. This created a dependency cycle... Decision: Moved `IAgent` protocol definition to `modules/system/api.py`.*
  > *Several key financial components were using `float` for monetary values... Decisions: CentralBank: Added runtime type guards to `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `mint` to strictly enforce `int` inputs, catching float incursions early.*
- **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight is highly accurate and valuable. Moving `IAgent` to the system foundation layer is a textbook fix for architectural layering violations. The explicit inclusion of test evidence within the report (passing 100%) proves that the refactor maintained regression safety. The identification of float incursions at runtime validates the need for active type guards over passive type hints.

## 6. 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

**Draft Content**:
```markdown
### Circular Dependencies in Protocols
- **현상**: Static analysis tools (`mypy`) reported "not defined" errors for core protocols like `IAgent` due to cyclical imports across layered boundaries (`system` -> `simulation` -> `finance` -> `system`).
- **원인**: High-level simulation modules were defining base protocols that lower-level foundation modules required, violating strict layer dependencies.
- **해결**: Foundational protocols (`IAgent`) must be defined in the lowest possible layer (`modules/system/api.py`) to allow unimpeded upward imports.
- **교훈**: When defining `Protocol` classes, always place them in the most foundational module possible, independent of their primary implementers, to prevent cyclic import deadlocks.

### Penny Standard Type Safety Guarding
- **현상**: Float arithmetic creeping into financial components despite type hints (e.g., `amount = 0.0` returning floats dynamically in `TransactionProcessor`).
- **해결**: Introduced explicit `int()` casting and runtime `TypeError` guards in critical monetary boundary methods (`CentralBank.deposit`).
- **교훈**: Type hinting `amount: int` is insufficient against runtime float propagation in Python. Boundary APIs dealing with the system ledger must actively and explicitly reject or strictly round floats to maintain the Penny Standard.
```

## 7. ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**
The PR structurally improves system stability, successfully adheres to the Penny Standard, provides excellent test evidence, and contains a well-documented insight report.
