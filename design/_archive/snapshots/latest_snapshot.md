# 📁 Context Manager: Session Snapshot

## 📍 Current Coordinates
- **Phase:** 24 (Adaptive Intelligence & Evolution)
- **Active Work Orders:**
 - `` (The Smart Leviathan): **Logic Complete**, System Check ⚠️ (Sensor OK, Economy Dead).
 - `` (Economic CPR): **Pending Implementation** (Critical Priority).
 - `` (The Invisible Hand): **Shadow Mode** (Money Leak -999.8 investigation ongoing).
- **Key Files:** `modules/government/policy_brain.py`, `modules/production/firms.py`, `scripts/gemini_worker.py`

## ✅ Accomplishments
- ** (Stabilization)**: Money supply leaks plugged (mostly), Lender of Last Resort & Labor Guard implemented.
- ** (AI Policy)**:
 - Q-Learning Brain (81 states) & Mutation logic integrated.
 - Policy Translation Layer (Action → Tax/IR) connected.
 - "Crisis Override" (GDP=0 trigger) added to Sensory Pipeline.
- **Infrastructure**: `gemini_worker.py` (Context/Verify/Spec) operational.

## 🚧 Blockers & Pending
- **CRITICAL: Economic Flatline**: Production engine has stalled (`L=0`, `K=0`, `Supply=0`). The AI Government works, but has no economy to rule.
- **Money Leak**: A persistent `-999.8` leak remains in `` shadow logs.
- **Pending Action**: `` (Bootstrap Fix) must be executed immediately to inject initial inventory and revive the loop.

**[Session Context: Phase 24 - Resuscitation Mode]**

We are currently stabilizing "The Smart Leviathan" (). The AI Government's Brain (Q-Learning) and Sensors are fully operational, but the patient (Economy) has flatlined during the transition.

**Current Status:**
1. **AI System**: Ready. Can issue 5-types of fiscal/monetary actions.
2. **Economic Vitality**: **CRITICAL**. `L=0, K=0, Supply=0` detected. The simulation stops because firms cannot produce.
3. **Active Leak**: `-999.8` currency leak observed in Shadow Mode ().

**Immediate Mission:**
1. **Execute (Economic CPR)**: Implement `Bootstrap Inventory Injection` in `firms.py` to restart the production cycle.
2. **Debug Leak**: Trace the -999.8 sink (Likely `Firm.liquidation` or `Government.subsidy` calculation error).
3. **Resume **: Once GDP > 0, enable the AI Policy Engine and verify learning.

**Command:** Start `` implementation to revive the production engine.
