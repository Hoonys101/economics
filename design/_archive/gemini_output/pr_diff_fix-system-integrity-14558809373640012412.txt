+# Insight Report: Registry & System Integrity Fixes
+
+## Architectural Insights
+
+### Registry Service Lock
+The `MissionRegistryService` was failing due to a missing `LOCK_PATH` module-level constant which was expected by tests and potentially other consumers.
+- **Fix**: Restored `LOCK_PATH` in `_internal/registry/service.py` pointing to `_internal/registry/mission_db.lock`.
+- **Improvement**: Updated `MissionLock.__init__` to use `LOCK_PATH` as a fallback via runtime lookup (`lock_file or LOCK_PATH`) rather than a bind-time default argument. This allows tests to patch `LOCK_PATH` effectively without needing to patch the class constructor, improving testability and robustness.
+
+### M2 Integrity Leak
+The `MonetaryLedger` was incorrectly classifying `loan_interest` as M2 contraction and `deposit_interest` as M2 expansion.
+- **Analysis**: While these transactions affect agent balances, they represent transfers of existing money (between Banks and Agents) rather than the creation or destruction of money supply (M2).
+- **Fix**: Removed `deposit_interest` from the expansion list and `loan_interest` from the contraction list in `modules/government/components/monetary_ledger.py`.
+- **Result**: Validated that internal transfers are now neutral (0.0 delta) in M2 calculations, adhering to the "Zero-Sum Integrity" guardrail.
