# 🐙 Gemini Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR addresses **TD-AI-DEBT-AWARE** by introducing debt sensitivity to `HouseholdAI` and `ConsumptionManager`. It implements a Debt Service Ratio (DSR) penalty that reduces both the AI's internal reward and the allowable consumption budget when debt burdens become critical. Comprehensive tests have been added to verify these behaviors.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None detected.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Magic Numbers**:
    *   `simulation/ai/household_ai.py:488`: `assets * 0.0001`. The daily asset yield proxy (0.01%) is hardcoded. While explained in the insight, this should ideally be a configurable parameter (e.g., `ESTIMATED_DAILY_ASSET_YIELD`) to allow tuning without code modification.
    *   `simulation/ai/household_ai.py:490`: `1e-09` is used for division-by-zero protection. Prefer a standard epsilon constant.
*   **Implicit Config Defaults**:
    *   The code relies heavily on `getattr(config, "key", default)` (e.g., defaults `0.4` and `500.0`). If the `HouseholdConfigDTO` is not updated to explicitly include these fields, the system relies on these "hidden" defaults, which can obscure the intended behavior during configuration audits.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Refactor Constants**: Extract `0.0001` and the defaults (`0.4`, `500.0`) into `HouseholdConfigDTO` or module-level constants to improve maintainability and visibility.
*   **Config Formalization**: Ensure `debt_penalty_multiplier` and `dsr_critical_threshold` are explicitly added to the `HouseholdConfigDTO` definition in `simulation/dtos/config_dtos.py` (not included in this diff, but implied).

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: *"The asset income proxy in DSR calculation was refined to 0.0001 (0.01%) daily return to reflect more realistic yield expectations, avoiding artificially low DSR values."*
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight correctly identifies the need for a heuristic to handle "asset-rich, income-poor" agents. The chosen value (approx 3.7% APY) is a reasonable baseline proxy for liquidatable wealth. The explicit mention of "No Regressions Detected" with specific test evidence is a good practice.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
### ID: TD-AI-DEBT-AWARE
- **Title**: AI Constraint Blindness (Log Spam)
- **Symptom**: AI proposes aggressive investments while in a debt spiral.
- **Risk**: Inefficient decision-making. AI fails to "learn" the barrier.
- **Solution**: Implemented DSR-based reward penalties in `HouseholdAI` and budget constriction in `ConsumptionManager` (Wave 6).
- **Current Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (Wave 6)
```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The changes successfully implement the required logic to make agents debt-aware, resolving a known technical debt item. The inclusion of a dedicated test suite (`tests/unit/ai/test_debt_constraints.py`) and the regression analysis in the insight report demonstrate high diligence. The logic is pure and does not violate Zero-Sum or Stateless Engine patterns.
