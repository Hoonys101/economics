# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 1. 🔍 Summary
This PR introduces **Nash Bargaining** to the `LaborMarket` and **Adaptive Learning** to the `HREngine`.
- **Labor Market**: Wages are now determined by splitting the surplus ($Offer - Reservation$) between the firm and the job seeker (default 50/50 split).
- **Firm Engine**: Implemented a TD-Error based feedback loop where firms adjust wage offers based on the previous tick's hiring success/failure.
- **State Management**: Updated `Firm.reset()` and DTOs (`HRStateDTO`, `HRContextDTO`) to rotate and persist tick-to-tick history (`hires_prev_tick`, etc.) specifically for this learning mechanism.

## 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None. No security violations or hardcoded secrets found.

## 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Volatile Wage Reset (Oscillation Risk)**:
    *   In `simulation/components/engines/hr_engine.py` (Lines 77-83 of the logic block), if a firm successfully fills its quota (`hiring_deficit <= 0`), the `anchor_wage` resets to `base_wage` (Market Avg).
    *   **Scenario**: Market Avg is 10. Firm offered 20 (high premium) to attract workers and succeeded. Next tick, `anchor` resets to 10. Even with a small premium, the offer drops significantly (e.g., to 11). This could cause the firm to lose its workforce immediately if retention depends on competitive wages, leading to a "Hire-Fire-Hire" oscillation.
    *   **Recommendation**: Decay slowly from `last_offer` rather than resetting to `base_wage`.
*   **Negative Surplus Handling**:
    *   In `modules/labor/system.py`, if `surplus <= 0` (Offer < Reservation), the code sets `best_wage = offer.offer_wage`.
    *   Unless `_calculate_match_score` strictly filters these out, this logic implies a worker might accept a job *below* their reservation wage, violating the definition of `reservation_wage`.

## 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Hardcoded Parameters**:
    *   `modules/labor/system.py`: `bargaining_power = 0.5`. This is a significant economic parameter and should be externalized to `economy_params.yaml` (e.g., `labor_market.bargaining_power`).
    *   `simulation/components/engines/hr_engine.py`: `0.1` (Learning Rate) and `-0.01` (Decay Rate) are hardcoded. Suggest moving these to `FirmConfigDTO`.
*   **Surplus Visibility**:
    *   Consider logging the `surplus` value in the `Transaction` metadata for easier debugging of the "Efficiency" of the matching market.

## 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: Defined Nash Bargaining as Surplus Sharing ($WTP - WTA$) and Adaptive Learning using TD-Error. Noted the necessity of State Rotation for history access.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight accurately identifies the architectural shift. The section on **Regression Analysis** (Mock Drift) is excellent and provides clear "Fix" context, which is valuable for future refactoring. The logic regarding State Rotation is sound and follows the Lifecycle Hygiene standards.

## 6. 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/1_governance/architecture/ARCH_AGENTS.md`

```markdown
### 3.3 Adaptive Learning & History Rotation (Feedback Loops)
- **Concept**: Agents implement reinforcement learning concepts (TD-Error) by comparing "Target" vs "Actual" outcomes from the *previous* tick.
- **Mechanism**: 
  - **State Rotation**: At the `reset()` phase (Post-Tick), current counters (e.g., `hires_this_tick`) are moved to history fields (e.g., `hires_prev_tick`) and zeroed out.
  - **Stateless Input**: Decision Engines receive both current context and these history fields via DTOs to calculate adjustments (e.g., Wage Premium correction).
- **Application**: Used in `HREngine` to adjust wage offers based on hiring deficits, allowing firms to "feel out" the market price without direct access to order books.
```

## 7. ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR implements the requested features with solid test coverage and no critical errors. The "Volatile Wage Reset" and hardcoded parameters are noted as risks/debt but do not violate the core "Zero-Sum" or "Security" mandates required for a rejection. The implementation of the State Rotation pattern is correct.
