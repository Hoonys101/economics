# Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
Implemented `PlatformLockManager` to support cross-platform file locking (Windows `msvcrt` / Unix `fcntl`), replacing the hard dependency on `fcntl`. Refactored `SimulationInitializer` to link `AgentRegistry` before the `Bootstrapper` phase, resolving the `TD-INIT-RACE` dependency issue. Added global `pytest` fixtures to mock locking mechanisms in the test environment.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Unrelated Test Failure**: The provided `test_results.txt` shows a failure in `tests/integration/test_config_hot_swap.py` (`test_defaults_loaded`: `FORMULA_TECH_LEVEL` expected `0.0` but got `1.0`). While likely unrelated to the locking logic, verify that this is a pre-existing issue and not a side effect of the `SimulationInitializer` refactoring affecting config/strategy loading.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Locking Resilience**: The current `acquire` implementation raises `LockAcquisitionError` immediately if locked. For robust production deployment (outside of `SimulationInitializer` which acts as a singleton guard), consider implementing a retry mechanism with a timeout in future iterations if this lock manager is reused for other resources.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**:
    > **Component**: `modules/platform/infrastructure/lock_manager.py`
    > **Insight**: Segregated OS-specific locking logic (`fcntl` for Unix, `msvcrt` for Windows) into a `PlatformLockManager` implementing `ILockManager`.
    > **Resolution**: Reordered `SimulationInitializer.build_simulation` to link `AgentRegistry` immediately after System Agents (Gov, Bank, CB) are instantiated and registered.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight accurately captures the architectural necessity of abstracting OS-level primitives. The identification of `TD-INIT-RACE` (Registry linking order) is particularly high-value, as it explains a subtle dependency cycle that would otherwise cause intermittent "missing agent" errors during bootstrapping. The resolution strategy is sound.

    | ID | Date | Component | Issue | Resolution | Status |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | TD-INIT-RACE | 2026-02-23 | SimulationInitializer | `SettlementSystem` (used by `Bootstrapper`) failed to resolve agent IDs during initial wealth distribution because `AgentRegistry` was linked to `WorldState` too late. | Reordered initialization: Linked `AgentRegistry` immediately after System Agent instantiation, before `Bootstrapper` execution. | Resolved |
    | TD-PLATFORM-LOCK | 2026-02-23 | Platform | Hard dependency on `fcntl` prevented simulation execution on Windows. | Implemented `PlatformLockManager` supporting both `msvcrt` (Windows) and `fcntl` (Unix). | Resolved |
