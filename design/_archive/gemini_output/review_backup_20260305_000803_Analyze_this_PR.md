# Code Review Report

## 1. 🔍 Summary
This PR successfully resolves a critical memory and mock-identity leak within the testing framework by replacing greedy `MagicMock` instances with terminal `Mock` objects in `ShallowModuleMock`. As a result of enforcing strict mocking semantics, several implicit dependencies across integration tests were exposed and subsequently fixed by utilizing explicit DTO instantiation and accurate assertion patterns.

## 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found. No security violations, external hardcoding, or Zero-Sum integrity breaches detected.

## 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Test Abstraction Bypass (Government Finance Tests)**: In `test_government_finance.py` and `test_government_fiscal_policy.py`, the expression `getattr(tx.metadata, "original_metadata", {}).get(...)` is used. While this fixes the test regression, it acts as a test-specific duct-tape that extracts an underlying dictionary rather than interacting strictly with the `TransactionMetadataDTO` class properties. 

## 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Refactor Transaction Metadata Mocking**: Rather than relying on `original_metadata` or bypassing the `__getattr__` logic with `MagicMock.side_effect` (as seen in `test_audit_integrity.py`), explicitly instantiate `TransactionMetadataDTO` with the expected fields during test setup. This adheres to configuration purity and ensures tests validate real interfaces, not the mock framework's fallback behavior.

## 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**:
    > The codebase included a custom fallback mocking utility, `ShallowModuleMock`, inside `tests/conftest.py`, designed to intercept and stub missing dynamic libraries (`pydantic`, `numpy`, etc.) gracefully.
    >
    > However, its implementation suffered from an identity leak and infinite mock recursion. When dynamically accessing attributes, `ShallowModuleMock.__getattr__` was originally assigning and returning a standard `MagicMock`. Because `MagicMock` implements its own greedy chaining on `setattr`/`getattr`, this created runaway mock graphs and multiple redundant references for every missing module attribute, severely impacting memory and test stability.
    >
    > **Technical Debt Resolved:**
    > The mock identity leak was fixed by explicitly creating a terminal `Mock` (instead of `MagicMock`) inside the `__getattr__` function, completely halting implicit mock chaining. Furthermore, `object.__setattr__(self, name, mock_obj)` was introduced to strictly bypass `MagicMock`'s custom magic methods. This guarantees absolute singleton identity mapping for dynamically requested missing attributes.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: 
    The original insight is exceptionally high quality. It accurately identifies a complex and highly destructive technical debt regarding Python's `MagicMock` implicit chaining and greedy attribute assignment. The fix (`Mock` + `object.__setattr__`) demonstrates a profound understanding of internal mock mechanics. Furthermore, diagnosing and resolving the resulting "Mock Drift" proves that the previous test environment was hiding structural type errors behind hallucinated mock objects.

    ### [RESOLVED] Testing Stability: MagicMock Runaway Chaining
    - **현상 (Symptom)**: `ShallowModuleMock`의 무한 Mock 재귀로 인해 대규모 메모리 누수 발생 및 테스트 실행/수집 지연. 여러 통합 테스트가 DTO의 누락된 속성을 임의로 생성해주는 Mock의 특성에 의존하는 "Mock Drift" 상태였음.
    - **원인 (Root Cause)**: `ShallowModuleMock.__getattr__`가 `MagicMock`을 반환하여, 모든 중첩된 속성 요청마다 새로운 Mock을 무한히 파생시키며 상태 그래프를 기하급수적으로 팽창시킴.
    - **해결 (Resolution)**: `MagicMock` 대신 더 이상 체이닝되지 않는 단말 `Mock` 객체를 반환하도록 수정하고, SSoT 기반의 Identity 보장을 위해 `object.__setattr__(self, name, mock_obj)`를 도입하여 커스텀 Magic Method를 우회함.
    - **교훈 (Lesson Learned)**: 동적 모듈 인터셉터나 광범위한 stubbing 환경에서는 반드시 터미널 단계가 보장되는 `Mock`을 사용해야 함. 테스트에서 DTO의 구체적 인스턴스화 대신 `MagicMock`의 관대함에 기대는 것은 통합 버그를 은폐하고 시스템 순수성을 훼손하는 심각한 기술 부채를 유발함.
