# Code Review: TD-122 Test Directory Organization

## 🔍 Summary

This pull request successfully reorganizes the `tests/` directory into `unit`, `integration`, and `stress` subdirectories, fulfilling the mandate of TD-122. The changes significantly improve the test structure for better maintainability and CI/CD optimization. It also includes necessary code refactoring in tests to adapt to evolving component interfaces (e.g., using DTOs).

## 🚨 Critical Issues

None. The audit found no security violations, hardcoded credentials, or critical logic flaws.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps

None. The implementation aligns perfectly with the goal of TD-122. The refactoring within `tests/stress/test_stress_scenarios.py` is particularly noteworthy:

*   **Improved Verification**: The hyperinflation/deflation tests were updated to verify calls to the `settlement_system` (`create_and_transfer`, `transfer_and_destroy`). This is a more robust approach than asserting the state of a mock object's attributes, as it directly tests the intended financial operations and adheres to Zero-Sum principles.
*   **Decoupling from Agents**: Tests are being refactored to use `HouseholdStateDTO` and `HouseholdConfigDTO` instead of complex `MagicMock` setups for the `Household` agent itself. This is an excellent pattern that reduces test brittleness and focuses tests on the logic within the decision engine rather than the agent's internal state management.

## 💡 Suggestions

*   **DTO-based Testing Pattern**: The move towards using DTOs (`HouseholdStateDTO`, `DecisionContext`) as the primary input for testing decision engines (`test_stress_scenarios.py`) is a commendable architectural improvement. This pattern should be adopted as the standard for all new unit and integration tests for decision logic, as it enhances modularity and simplifies test setup.

## 🧠 Manual Update Proposal

Not applicable. The developer correctly followed the decentralized protocol by creating a new, mission-specific insight report (`communications/insights/TD-122_Test_Directory_Organization.md`) instead of proposing a change to a central ledger. The report is detailed, well-structured, and provides valuable context for the changes.

## ✅ Verdict

**APPROVE**

This is an exemplary execution of a major refactoring task. The code changes are clean, the test logic is improved, and the required insight report is comprehensive and correctly filed.
