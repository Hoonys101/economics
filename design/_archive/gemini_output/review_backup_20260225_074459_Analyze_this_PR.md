# Code Review Report

## 1. 🔍 Summary
This PR implements the `EstateRegistry` to temporarily hold deceased/liquidated agents. It gracefully removes the "resurrection hack" in the `EscheatmentHandler` and properly updates `WorldState.calculate_total_money` to include estate funds, thereby preventing M2 leaks during the death lifecycle.

## 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   **None found in the codebase.** No hardcoding, security violations, or magic money creation/destruction detected.

## 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Missing Insight Report (Hard-Fail):** The PR Diff does not contain any new file or modifications in `communications/insights/`. According to operational protocols, documenting the technical debt and insight gained during implementation is mandatory.
*   **Coupling in Registry:** In `modules/system/registry.py`, `AgentRegistry.get_agent` uses `hasattr(self._state, 'estate_registry')` to find the estate registry. This loosely couples the `AgentRegistry` to the specific shape of `WorldState`.

## 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Dependency Injection for EstateRegistry:** Instead of having `AgentRegistry` dynamically inspect `self._state` for `estate_registry`, inject the `EstateRegistry` directly into `AgentRegistry` (e.g., via a `set_estate_registry` method or during initialization). This adheres better to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
*   **Penny Conversion in Tests:** In `tests/integration/test_m2_integrity.py`, `1000.0` was changed to `100000`, but verify that `self.ledger.get_monetary_delta()` has actually been updated elsewhere to return integers (pennies) instead of floats, to prevent test failures.

## 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight:** [Not provided in PR Diff]
*   **Reviewer Evaluation:** **FAILED.** Jules failed to submit an insight report in the `communications/insights/` directory. This implementation teaches a valuable lesson about Lifecycle state transitions—specifically, that agents cannot simply be deleted if asynchronous financial settlements (like escheatment or final tax collection) still depend on their existence in the registry. This lesson must be documented.

    ### Insight: The Necessity of an Estate Registry for Asynchronous Settlement
    - **현상 (Phenomenon):** Deceased or liquidated agents caused `SettlementSystem` failures (Agent Not Found) during Escheatment, or required dangerous "resurrection hacks" where dead agents were temporarily injected back into the transaction context. Furthermore, funds held by dead agents before final escheatment were entirely dropped from the M2 Money Supply calculations, breaking Zero-Sum integrity.
    - **원인 (Cause):** Agents were being abruptly deleted from `AgentRegistry` in the `DeathSystem`. However, financial settlements (like transferring remaining assets to the government) happen asynchronously or later in the transaction processing pipeline. 
    - **해결 (Solution):** Implemented an `EstateRegistry` (`IEstateRegistry`). `DeathSystem` now moves dead agents to the `EstateRegistry` rather than completely deleting them. `AgentRegistry.get_agent` is configured to fallback to the `EstateRegistry`, allowing `SettlementSystem` to seamlessly resolve and settle accounts of dead agents. `WorldState.calculate_total_money` also iterates over the estate to maintain accurate M2.
    - **교훈 (Lesson Learned):** In a strict Double-Entry system, an entity cannot cease to exist if it still holds liabilities or assets. A "limbo" or "estate" state is mandatory to guarantee financial integrity during cleanup phases.

## 7. ✅ Verdict
**REQUEST CHANGES (Hard-Fail)**
*   **Reason:** The implementation logic is structurally sound and effectively fixes the underlying lifecycle bugs. However, the mandatory insight report (`communications/insights/*.md`) is completely missing from the PR Diff. Please create the insight report detailing the "Estate Registry" architecture and update the PR.
