# 🛡️ Gemini CLI Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR addresses critical test regressions by aligning the `FiscalEngine` with the Core System's DTO standards (switching input to `MarketSnapshotDTO` dataclass) and enforcing strict Zero-Sum principles in the `HouseholdFactory` (initializing wallet assets to 0.0). It also hardens integration tests against "Mock Drift" by explicitly configuring mock return values.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found. Security and hardcoding checks passed.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **DTO Inconsistency (Internal)**: While the `FiscalEngine` input was updated to use a dataclass (`MarketSnapshotDTO`), the output remains a `TypedDict` (`FiscalDecisionDTO`), whereas the `IGovernmentDecisionEngine` protocol typically expects a `PolicyDecisionDTO` dataclass. The integration test update (`assert isinstance(decision, dict)`) confirms this divergence. This is acceptable for an internal component but creates a mixed data model.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Unified DTO Standards**: Future refactoring should migrate `FiscalEngine`'s return type from `FiscalDecisionDTO` (TypedDict) to a proper Dataclass to ensure type safety throughout the entire pipeline, matching the `IGovernmentDecisionEngine` interface.
*   **Factory Funding Explicitly**: The change to `agent.assets = 0.0` in `HouseholdFactory` is excellent for Zero-Sum integrity. Ensure that the caller (or a settlement service) is explicitly responsible for the initial funding transfer if agents are expected to start with wealth.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation

*   **Original Insight**:
    > "The decision was made to **align the Engine with the Core System**, updating `FiscalEngine` to use the `dataclass` definition and dot notation (`market.market_data`). This reinforces the **DTO Purity** guardrail by moving away from loose dictionaries towards structured objects."
    > "We encountered a regression where `FiscalEngine` ... was expecting a `TypedDict` ... while the core system ... had evolved `MarketSnapshotDTO` into a `dataclass`."

*   **Reviewer Evaluation**:
    The insight correctly identifies a key architectural friction point ("DTO Schism") between legacy TypedDicts and modern Dataclasses. The "Mock Discipline" section regarding `MagicMock` poisoning arithmetic operations is particularly valuable and should be codified in our testing standards. The insight is actionable and accurately reflects the root cause of the regression.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
| **TD-ARCH-DTO-SCHISM** | Architecture | **DTO Mixed Models**: `FiscalEngine` accepts Dataclass input but returns TypedDict output (`FiscalDecisionDTO`), causing type inconsistency with `IGovernmentDecisionEngine`. | **Medium**: Type Safety. | **Identified** |
```
