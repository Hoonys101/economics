+# Escheatment Implementation & Debt Settlement Report (WO-178)
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+This mission (WO-178) implements the 'Escheatment' logic within `SettlementSystem.record_liquidation` to ensuring residual assets from liquidated agents (specifically Firms) are transferred to the Government instead of vanishing. This enforces zero-sum integrity by preventing money leaks during bankruptcy/liquidation.
+
+This report also includes the mandatory Debt Settlement Report as requested.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Technical Debt & Insights
+
+### [TD-178] Fragmentation of Liquidation Logic
+**Status**: Resolved (in progress)
+**Description**: Liquidation and escheatment logic was scattered across `AgentLifecycleManager`, `MAManager`, and `SettlementSystem`.
+- `MAManager` manually transferred cash to Government.
+- `AgentLifecycleManager` manually transferred cash to Government.
+- `SettlementSystem.record_liquidation` only logged stats.
+**Resolution**: Logic centralized in `SettlementSystem.record_liquidation`. Callers now delegate the "sweep" to this method.
+
+### [Insight] Household Inheritance vs Firm Liquidation
+- `InheritanceManager` (Phase 22) uses a transaction-based queue for household death (taxation + distribution).
+- Firm liquidation uses immediate `SettlementSystem` transfers.
+- **Decision**: The new `record_liquidation` sweep logic is applied to Firms. Households continue to use `InheritanceManager` to avoid conflicting with the transaction queue and heir distribution logic.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Debt Settlement Report: Operation Solid Ground (2026-01-31)
+
+### Executive Summary
+This report details the audit of active technical debt and provides the architectural specifications for the next phase of stabilization. By moving these critical items to 'SPECCED' status, we reduce systemic uncertainty.
+
+### Conflict Zone Audit (Resource Lock Management)
+| Conflict Zone | Impacted Files | Related Debts |
+|---|---|---|
+| **Financial Settlement** | `simulation/systems/transaction_processor.py`, `simulation/systems/settlement_system.py` | TD-160, TD-175, TD-176 |
+| **Market Data Contracts** | `simulation/models.py`, `simulation/core_markets.py`, `simulation/decisions/*` | TDL-028, TD-151 |
+| **Agent Configuration** | `simulation/core_agents.py`, `config/economy_params.yaml` | TD-162, TD-166 |
+| **Database/Persistence** | `simulation/db/repository.py`, `simulation/world_state.py` | TD-140 |
+
+### Architectural Specifications (Spec-as-Repayment)
+
+#### [TD-160] Transaction-Tax Atomicity (Escrow Model)
+- **Concept**: Implement `SettlementSystem.settle_escrow(payer, payments, memo)` to replace sequential transfers.
+- **Protocol**:
+  1. Calculate `total_amount`.
+  2. Withdraw `total_amount` from `payer`.
+  3. Attempt deposits to all `payees`.
+  4. If any deposit fails, rollback all previous deposits and refund the `payer`.
+- **Target Implementation**: `simulation/systems/settlement_system.py`.
+
+#### [TDL-028] Standardized Order DTO Contract
+- **Concept**: Introduce an immutable `OrderDTO` to replace raw dictionaries/tuples in the decision-to-market pipeline.
+- **Contract Fields**: `order_id`, `agent_id`, `market_id`, `item_id`, `quantity`, `side`, `price_limit`, `status`, `created_at`.
+- **Target Implementation**: `modules/market/api.py` (New) and `simulation/models.py`.
+
+#### [TD-176] Decoupling TransactionProcessor & Government
+- **Concept**: Introduce `TaxationSystemInterface` to move tax logic out of the processor.
+- **Workflow**:
+  1. `TransactionProcessor` receives a trade.
+  2. It asks `TaxationSystem` for associated tax "intents".
+  3. It bundles all intents into a single `settle_escrow` call.
+- **Target Implementation**: `modules/government/taxation/api.py`.
+
+### Verdict
+The legacy technical debts TD-160, TDL-028, and TD-176 are now officially **SPECCED**.
