# 🐙 Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR resolves the **"Ghost Constant Binding" (TD-CONF-GHOST-BIND)** technical debt by unifying `ConfigProxy` and `GlobalRegistry`. It ensures the `config` module acts as a true Single Source of Truth (SSoT) with runtime value resolution, enabling hot-swapping. The changes include rigorous protocol implementation (`IConfigurationRegistry`) and improved handling of `None` values.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Minor Redundancy**: in `ConfigProxy.__getattr__`, the fallback to `self._defaults_module` (Lines 87-89) is theoretically redundant if `bootstrap_from_module` works correctly (which iterates and sets all uppercase keys). However, keeping it as a "safety net" for legacy compatibility is acceptable for now, provided it doesn't mask registry population failures.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Future Cleanup**: Once the new registry system is proven stable in production, consider removing the fallback logic in `__getattr__` to enforce strict registry usage and fail fast if a key is missing from the SSoT.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**:
    > "The codebase previously had a split-brain configuration issue... We have unified this by refactoring ConfigProxy to wrap a GlobalRegistry instance... This ensures a Single Source of Truth (SSoT)... We identified and fixed a bug where configuration values set to None were incorrectly treated as missing keys."
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**:
    The insight accurately captures the architectural shift. The identification of the "None value vs. Missing key" bug is particularly valuable, as this is a common source of subtle logic errors in Python configuration wrappers. The regression analysis covering 953 tests provides high confidence.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

### Target File
`design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

### Draft Content
```markdown
### ID: TD-CONF-GHOST-BIND
- **Title**: Ghost Constant Binding (Import Time)
- **Symptom**: Constants locked at import time prevent effective runtime hot-swaps.
- **Risk**: Prevents dynamic tuning.
- **Solution**: Use a `ConfigProxy` that resolves values at access time. Refactored in `Wave 5` to wrap `GlobalRegistry`.
- **Status**: **RESOLVED** (Verified in PR `jules-wave5-config-purity`)
```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR correctly addresses the architectural debt, improves system robustness, and includes comprehensive test evidence. Security and Logic checks pass.
