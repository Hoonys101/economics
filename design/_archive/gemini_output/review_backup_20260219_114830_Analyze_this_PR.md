# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 🔍 Summary
This PR completes the transition from the legacy `TransactionManager` to the modular `TransactionProcessor` architecture. It deletes the deprecated `TransactionManager`, refactors key integration tests (`OMO`, `PublicManager`, `TaxIncidence`) to use the new processor and handlers, and fixes a regression in `MonetaryTransactionHandler` where Quantitative Tightening (QT) was not correctly logging money destruction.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found. The removal of the legacy file is clean, and tests are updated to reflect the new dependency injection pattern.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   None found. The logic for OMO and Public Manager transactions appears to be correctly migrated to their respective handlers, as evidenced by the passing tests.
*   **Zero-Sum Verification**: The `MonetaryTransactionHandler` now correctly delegates to `context.settlement_system.transfer`, ensuring that the `SettlementSystem` (the Financial SSoT) enforces zero-sum constraints. The added logging for `total_money_destroyed` correctly listens to the success of this transfer.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Tech Debt Ledger**: The successful removal of `TransactionManager` and the unification of transaction logic resolves the open debt item **TD-PROC-TRANS-DUP** ("Logic overlap between legacy TransactionManager and new TransactionProcessor"). This should be closed in `TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: *The refactoring confirms `TransactionProcessor` as the Single Source of Truth (SSoT)... Identified and fixed a regression in `MonetaryTransactionHandler` where `omo_sale` transactions... were not updating the `government.total_money_destroyed`...*
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight is accurate and valuable. It correctly identifies the architectural gain (SSoT) and highlights a specific, subtle functional fix (QT tracking) that might otherwise be missed. The test evidence provided is relevant and sufficient.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

**Draft Content**:
(Remove the row corresponding to `TD-PROC-TRANS-DUP` from the table as it is now resolved.)

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR effectively removes technical debt while maintaining system integrity. The tests prove that the new `TransactionProcessor` handles complex scenarios like OMO and Liquidation correctly. The inclusion of the Insight report meets the knowledge preservation requirements.
