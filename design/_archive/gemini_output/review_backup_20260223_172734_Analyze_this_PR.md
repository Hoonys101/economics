# Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR implements the **Wave 5 Populist Government AI**, upgrading the decision-making core from a 4-tuple technocrat to a **6-tuple political agent** that considers Public Approval and Lobbying Pressure. Key changes include a versioned Q-Table strategy (`v5_populist`), a configurable "Reflex Override" (allowing the AI to potentially ignore inflation if it serves populist goals), and a cleaner decoupling of state observation via `GovernmentStateDTO`.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None. Security and hardcoding checks passed.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   None. The implementation closely follows the provided Spec and properly handles the "Learn-then-Decide" sequence in the `SmartLeviathanPolicy` loop to ensure Q-Learning mathematical correctness.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **File Organization**: The Q-Table filename defaults to `q_table_v5_populist.pkl` in the current working directory. For better hygiene, consider pointing this to a dedicated `data/` or `artifacts/` directory in `AIConfigDTO` in a future patch.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: The author noted that the hardcoded `REFLEX_OVERRIDE` in previous versions acted as a "Technocratic" safety rail, preventing the AI from genuinely learning the consequences of high inflation. Downgrading this to a configurable constraint allows for "Populist" simulation modes.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: **Excellent**. This observation highlights a deep understanding of Reinforcement Learning dynamics—specifically, that "Safety Rails" can introduce bias that prevents the agent from exploring and understanding the state space fully (Moral Hazard). The decision to make it a configuration option is architecturally sound.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

### Technical Debt & Future Improvements
- [ ] **AI Migration Utility (Wave 6)**: The introduction of `q_table_v5_populist.pkl` creates a fragmented knowledge base. Implement a migration utility to transfer learned "macro-stability instincts" from V4 tables to V5+ tables to reduce training time, rather than starting from scratch (Tabula Rasa) every wave.
```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR is architecturally clean, strictly typed, and well-tested. The separation of the AI configuration into `AIConfigDTO` and the use of `GovernmentStateDTO` for sensory input significantly improves the purity and testability of the `GovernmentAI` module.
