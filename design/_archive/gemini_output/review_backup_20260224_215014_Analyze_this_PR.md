# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 🔍 Summary
This PR implements the "Solvency Gate" mechanism for firms and boosts initial household liquidity to act as a startup safety net.
*   **Logic**: Introduced `Solvency Gate` in `AgingSystem`. Firms with assets > 2x the closure threshold are immune to the "Zombie Timer" (consecutive loss closure), simulating a "Runway" concept.
*   **Refactoring**: Extracted `IAgingFirm` and `IFinanceEngine` protocols to `api.py` to resolve circular dependencies and enforce strict typing.
*   **Config**: Increased `INITIAL_HOUSEHOLD_ASSETS_MEAN` (500k -> 1M) and introduced a 5% tax rate (Income/Corporate) to transition from Laissez-Faire.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None. No hardcoded secrets or critical security violations found.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Config Duplication**: `config/defaults.py` contains duplicate definitions for `INITIAL_HOUSEHOLD_ASSETS_MEAN` and `CORPORATE_TAX_RATE` (appearing in both "Simulation Parameters" and later phase sections). The diff correctly updates both, but this duplication poses a high risk of future desynchronization.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Technical Debt (Config)**: The `config/defaults.py` file requires deduplication. Consider consolidating parameters into a single source of truth or using a strict hierarchy where later sections explicitly override earlier ones without redefining the variable name if not intended.
*   **Test Hygiene**: The `MockFirm` in `test_aging_system.py` manually mocks `finance_engine`. While `spec=IFinanceEngine` is used, ensure that future tests regarding bankruptcy logic actually exercise the interaction between `AgingSystem` and a real (or high-fidelity mock) `FinanceEngine`.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: "Implemented a 'Solvency Gate' in `AgingSystem`... protects firms that are technically 'active' but accumulating consecutive losses... IF their assets exceed 2x the closure threshold."
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: **High Value**. The "Solvency Gate" is a crucial economic stability mechanism. Without it, the "Zombie Timer" (intended to clean up dead firms) aggressively kills startups that are burning cash (investing) but still solvent (have runway). This distinction between "Insolvent" and "Pre-Revenue/Investing" is vital for the simulation's realism. The insight correctly identifies this as a "Module Decoupling" and "Protocol Purity" win.

    ### 🛡️ Solvency Gate (Firm Lifecycle)
    - **Purpose**: Prevents the premature liquidation of firms that are unprofitable (operating loss) but solvent (high liquidity).
    - **Mechanism**:
      - A firm is flagged for closure if `consecutive_loss_turns` >= `FIRM_CLOSURE_TURNS_THRESHOLD`.
      - **Override**: If `current_assets` > 2 * `ASSETS_CLOSURE_THRESHOLD`, the closure is bypassed.
    - **Economic Effect**: Allows startups ("Burn Rate") and distressed giants ("Restructuring") to survive as long as they have sufficient runway, decoupling "Profitability" from "Solvency".
    ```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The changes are logically sound, strictly typed, and covered by new test cases (`test_solvency_gate_active`). The configuration changes align with the "Safety Net" and "Liquidity Bootstrap" goals.
