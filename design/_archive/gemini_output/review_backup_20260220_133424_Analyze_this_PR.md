# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 📝 Code Review Report

### 1. 🔍 Summary
This PR resolves a critical `AttributeError` in `SystemCommandProcessor` by correcting the field access from `state.government` to `state.primary_government`, aligning with the strict `SimulationState` DTO definition. It also hardens `test_cockpit_flow.py` by removing reliance on private attributes (`_system_command_queue`) and enforcing DTO/Protocol fidelity via `MagicMock(spec=SimulationState)`.

### 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found. The changes enforce architectural standards (DTO purity) and improve security (removing private member access).

### 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   None. The logic changes directly address the identified technical debt items.

### 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Future Cleanup**: Ensure `IGovernment` protocol explicitly defines `corporate_tax_rate` to avoid `hasattr` checks or dynamic lookups downstream, further strengthening `isinstance` checks.

### 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: `TD-ARCH-GOV-MISMATCH` identified that `SystemCommandProcessor` accessed `state.government` (undefined on `SimulationState`), causing potential runtime errors. `TD-TEST-COCKPIT-MOCK` noted fragility in tests accessing private queues.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insights are technically accurate and the resolution is robust. The shift to `state.primary_government` explicitly resolves the ambiguity between the singleton government and the list `governments`. The test update correctly moves from implementation-detail verification (checking a private queue) to state-based verification (checking the effect on the government object).

### 6. 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
| **TD-ARCH-GOV-MISMATCH** | Architecture | **Singleton vs List**: `WorldState` has `governments` (List) vs Singleton `government`. | **Medium**: Logic Fragility. | **Fixed** |
| **TD-TEST-COCKPIT-MOCK** | Testing | **Cockpit 2.0 Mock Regressions**: Tests use deprecated `system_command_queue`. | **High**: Silent Test Failure. | **Fixed** |
| **TD-TEST-LIFE-STALE** | Testing | **Stale Lifecycle Logic**: `test_engine.py` calls refactored `_handle_agent_liquidation`. | **High**: Test Breakdown. | **Fixed** |
```

### 7. ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR successfully fixes architectural mismatches and improves test stability without introducing security risks or logic regressions. The inclusion of the Insight Report verifies the changes against the technical debt ledger.
