# Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
- **Financial Integrity**: Converted critical monetary configuration values (`INITIAL_HOUSEHOLD_ASSETS_MEAN`, etc.) from `float` to `int` (pennies) in `config/defaults.py` to prevent floating-point drift.
- **Protocol Compliance**: Refactored `tests/unit/simulation/systems/test_audit_total_m2.py` to use strict `MagicMock(spec=IFinancialEntity)` with `PropertyMock`, aligning tests with the actual API contract.
- **Validation**: Introduced `scripts/check_defaults.py` to enforce integer types for monetary configuration keys and goods prices.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*None detected.*

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*None detected.*

## 💡 Suggestions
- **Script Coverage**: In `scripts/check_defaults.py`, the `monetary_keys` list includes `INITIAL_FIRM_CAPITAL_MEAN` but appears to be missing `INITIAL_HOUSEHOLD_ASSETS_MEAN`, which was one of the primary fields modified in this PR. Consider adding it to the validation list to ensure it remains an integer in the future.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
- **Original Insight**: "Type Leakage in Config DTOs (The Penny Gap)... All monetary configuration fields MUST be converted to `int` (pennies). This aligns the configuration layer with the Financial Integrity Standard."
- **Reviewer Evaluation**: **High Value**. The insight correctly identifies a fundamental source of financial inconsistency (floating-point errors at the injection point). Converting to integer pennies is the industry-standard solution. The report also correctly tracks the status of the "God Factory" issue, ensuring visibility even if code changes were previously applied.

```markdown
### [Resolved] Float Leakage in Configuration (The Penny Gap)
- **Date**: 2026-02-16
- **Symptom**: Monetary start-up values (e.g., Household Assets) were defined as `float` in `defaults.py`, risking precision loss when interacting with the integer-based `FinanceSystem`.
- **Resolution**: All monetary configuration constants converted to `int` (pennies). Added `scripts/check_defaults.py` to enforce this type constraint.

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR successfully enforces financial integrity by eliminating floating-point types in configuration and updates tests to strictly adhere to the `IFinancialEntity` protocol. The added validation script provides a good guardrail against regression.
