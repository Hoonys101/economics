# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 🔍 Summary
This PR refactors the finance system to replace fragile `hasattr` checks with strict `Protocol` definitions (`IRevenueTracker`, `ISalesTracker`, etc.), enhancing type safety and architectural purity. It also decouples the `SettlementSystem` from `AgentRegistry` by injecting a focused `IPanicRecorder`, resolving a circular dependency risk.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found. No security credentials or critical logic flaws detected.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Minor Residue**: `FinancialTransactionHandler` (Line 39) still retains a `hasattr(buyer, "capital_income_this_tick")` check for Households. While the comment acknowledges this ("Keeping hasattr check for now"), it prevents a 100% "Protocol Purity" state.
*   **Hardcoded Income**: In `FinanceSystem.request_bailout_loan` (Line 440+), `gross_income` is hardcoded to `0.0` in the `BorrowerProfileDTO`. While `BAILOUT_CREDIT_SCORE` likely bypasses the need for income verification, this magic number should ideally be documented or derived from `average_profit_pennies` if possible.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Household Protocol**: Consider adding an `IIncomeReceiver` or `ICapitalIncomeTracker` protocol for `Household` to remove the final `hasattr` check in `FinancialTransactionHandler`.
*   **Manual Update**: The PR effectively resolves `TD-PROTO-MONETARY` in the Technical Debt Ledger. I recommend updating the ledger status.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: *"The codebase was heavily relying on `hasattr` checks... We are introducing explicit protocols (`IRevenueTracker`, `ISalesTracker`, `IPanicRecorder`, etc.) in `modules/finance/api.py` to enforce type safety and clear contracts."*
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight accurately identifies a key source of system fragility. The solution adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by breaking down monolithic agent expectations into small, capable interfaces (`IPanicRecorder` is a great example). The regression analysis regarding Mock failures is spot-on and demonstrates proactive thinking.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
| TD-PROTO-MONETARY | Transaction | **Monetary Protocol Violation**: `MonetaryHandler` uses `hasattr` instead of Protocols. | **Low**: Fragility. | **RESOLVED** |
```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR significantly improves the robustness of the financial system. The logic is sound, tests are passing, and the architectural improvements (Protocol adoption, Dependency Injection) outweigh the minor residual `hasattr` check.
