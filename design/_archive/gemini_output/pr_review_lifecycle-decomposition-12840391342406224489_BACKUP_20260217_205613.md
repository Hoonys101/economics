# Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
The PR successfully decomposes the monolithic `AgentLifecycleManager` into three distinct sub-systems (`AgingSystem`, `BirthSystem`, `DeathSystem`) adhering to the `ILifecycleSubsystem` protocol. This significantly improves separation of concerns and testability.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
1.  **Potential Zero-Sum Violation (Money Creation)**:
    -   **File**: `simulation/systems/lifecycle/birth_system.py` (Line 88-96)
    -   **Issue**: The code calculates `initial_gift_pennies` and passes it to `household_factory.create_newborn`. However, there is no explicit instruction in `BirthSystem` to **deduct** these funds from `parent_agent`.
    -   **Risk**: If `create_newborn` (a factory method) purely creates the child instance without side-effecting the parent's wallet, this logic effectively prints money, violating the **FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY** standard.
    -   **Requirement**: Explicitly deduct the gift amount from the parent in `BirthSystem` (e.g., `parent_agent.wallet.withdraw(initial_gift_pennies)`) or prove via test that the factory handles the transfer.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
1.  **Hardcoded Magic Number**:
    -   **File**: `simulation/systems/lifecycle/aging_system.py` (Lines 72, 94)
    -   **Issue**: The grace period check uses a hardcoded literal `5` (`if firm.finance_state.distress_tick_counter <= 5`).
    -   **Recommendation**: Bind this to a config constant (e.g., `getattr(self.config, "DISTRESS_GRACE_PERIOD", 5)`).
2.  **Test Coverage Gap**:
    -   **File**: `tests/unit/systems/lifecycle/test_birth_system.py`
    -   **Issue**: The test verifies child creation but does **not** assert that the parent's balance decreases. This masks the potential zero-sum violation mentioned above.

## 💡 Suggestions
1.  **Explicit Transfer**: Even if the factory handles the transfer, moving the deduction logic into `BirthSystem.execute` improves auditability and makes the asset flow visible at the system level.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
-   **Original Insight**: _"The `AgentLifecycleManager` has been decomposed... adhering to SRP... Dependencies like `BreedingPlanner` are now injected..."_
-   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight is accurate regarding the structural changes and protocol usage. However, it overlooks the **Financial Integrity** risk introduced during the migration of the birth logic. The isolation of the "Grace Protocol" in `AgingSystem` is a good architectural decision that is well-documented.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
| TD-ARCH-LIFE-GOD | Systems | **God Manager**: `LifecycleManager` decomposition complete. Replaced by `Aging/Birth/Death` systems. | **Medium**: Coupling. | **Resolved** |
```

## ✅ Verdict
**REQUEST CHANGES (Hard-Fail)**

*Reason: Potential Zero-Sum violation in `BirthSystem` (missing parent asset deduction) and hardcoded magic numbers.*
