+# Insight: Conftest Cleanup (TD-210)
+
+## Context
+The `tests/conftest.py` file contained imports for `simulation.agents.central_bank.CentralBank` and `simulation.bank.Bank`. These imports were used solely for `spec` arguments in `unittest.mock.Mock`.
+
+## Problem
+`CentralBank` imports `numpy`, a heavy library. Importing it in `conftest.py` causes `numpy` to be loaded during test collection and initialization, even for tests that do not require it. This slows down the test suite startup time.
+
+## Solution
+- Removed `CentralBank` and `Bank` imports from `tests/conftest.py`.
+- Replaced `Mock(spec=CentralBank)` with `Mock()`.
+- Replaced `Mock(spec=Bank)` with `Mock()`.
+- Preserved the necessary attribute configurations on the mocks (`get_base_rate`, `_assets`).
+
+## Impact
+- **Test Initialization Speed**: Faster startup time for pytest, especially for non-simulation tests.
+- **Dependency Isolation**: Reduced coupling between `conftest.py` and simulation agents.
+- **Maintenance**: Less risk of circular imports or dependency issues in the test runner configuration.
+
+## Verification
+- Verified that `conftest.py` no longer imports `CentralBank` or `Bank`.
+- Verified that mocks are still configured correctly.
+- Tests depending on these fixtures should still pass as the mocks provide the necessary interface (duck typing).
