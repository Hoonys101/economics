# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 📝 Code Review Report

### 1. 🔍 Summary
This PR enforces **Single Source of Truth (SSoT)** compliance in `InheritanceManager` by explicitly setting `total_pennies` for transactions, aligning with the integer-based settlement architecture. It also modernizes `DeathSystem` and `IMarket` to use the `get_price` protocol method, reducing reliance on fragile `hasattr` checks, and adds a dedicated verification test suite `test_ssot_compliance.py`.

### 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found. Security and strict typing checks are satisfactory.

### 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Settlement System Strictness**: The change in `settlement_system.py` (`if isinstance(agent, IAgent) or hasattr(agent, 'id')`) allows for backward compatibility but technically still permits objects without the `IAgent` protocol if they have an `id`. This is acceptable for a transitional PR but should be noted as a future deprecation target.

### 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Deprecation Warning**: Consider adding a `logger.warning` in `settlement_system.py` when an agent passes via `hasattr` but fails `isinstance(agent, IAgent)` to identify remaining legacy agents.

### 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: Defined the shift from `hasattr` to `IMarket.get_price`, the `total_pennies` enforcement in `InheritanceManager`, and the maintenance of legacy fallback in `DeathSystem`.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight accurately reflects the architectural improvements. The explicit handling of `total_pennies` in `InheritanceManager` is a critical step towards resolving `TD-INT-PENNIES-FRAGILITY` and ensures the `SettlementSystem` receives integer data as expected. The test evidence provided is robust.

### 6. 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

The new test file `tests/unit/test_ssot_compliance.py` should be registered in the test architecture reference.

**Target File**: `design/1_governance/architecture/ARCH_TESTS.md`

```markdown
| tests/unit/test_ssot_compliance.py | simulation/systems/inheritance_manager.py, settlement_system.py | tests/unit/simulation/systems/test_ssot_compliance.py |
```

### 7. ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The changes successfully implement the SSoT requirements for `total_pennies` and modernize the market interfaces. The code is secure, and the new tests provide necessary verification.
