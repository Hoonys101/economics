# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 📝 Code Review Report

### 1. 🔍 Summary
This PR resolves the `AttributeError` "dict-leak" in `LoanMarket` by strictly enforcing `LoanInfoDTO` usage across the `Bank`, `LoanMarket`, and `FinanceSystem`. It eliminates legacy dictionary returns in favor of Dataclasses, ensuring type safety and fixing the `TD-DTO-DESYNC-2026` contract fracture. Verification tests confirm end-to-end DTO purity.

### 2. 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None identified. The changes adhere to security and integrity standards.

### 3. ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Minor Note on Currency Units**: The DTOs (e.g., `LoanInfoDTO`) cast penny integer values to floats (e.g., `float(loan.remaining_balance)`). Consumers of this DTO should be aware that the values likely represent **pennies-as-floats** (e.g., 1000.0 for $10.00) rather than dollars, consistent with the `FinanceSystem`'s internal state.

### 4. 💡 Suggestions
*   **Type Hint Refinement**: In `modules/finance/api.py`, `outstanding_balance: float` is used. Explicitly documenting unit (pennies vs dollars) in the docstring would prevent future confusion, although the current implementation is consistent with the `FinanceSystem` mapping.

### 5. 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: Defined the resolution of `TD-DTO-DESYNC-2026` by refactoring `modules/finance/api.py` to enforce strict DTO definitions and liquidating legacy dictionary mocks in tests.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: **Valid & Valuable**. The insight accurately captures the root cause (Dict vs DTO mismatch) and the solution. The distinction between "Strict DTOs" and "Protocol Compliance" is well-noted. The "Penny Migration" note correctly identifies that while the DTO uses floats, the underlying data source remains integer-based.

### 6. 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
| **TD-DTO-DESYNC-2026** | DTO/API | **Contract Fracture**: Resolved via strict `LoanInfoDTO` enforcement in LoanMarket/Bank. | **Critical**: System Integrity. | **Resolved** |
```

### 7. ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR effectively liquidates the targeted technical debt and improves the architectural integrity of the Financial module. The move to strict DTOs is a necessary step for the "Penny Standard" and type safety. Tests are comprehensive and prove the fix.
