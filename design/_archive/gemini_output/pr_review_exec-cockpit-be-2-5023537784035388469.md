# 🐙 Gemini CLI Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR introduces the **Genealogy System**, allowing retrieval of agent ancestors, descendants, and family trees. It includes a dedicated `GenealogyService`, strict Pydantic DTOs, a FastAPI router, and comprehensive unit tests. The implementation is read-only and respects Zero-Sum integrity.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None identified. Security and Integrity checks passed.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Test Location Strategy**: The new test file is located at `modules/demographics/genealogy/tests/test_genealogy.py`. According to `ARCH_TESTS.md` (Cleanup Campaign), the recommended target path for unit tests is `tests/unit/modules/...`. While not a hard failure, adopting the centralized structure now avoids future technical debt.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Move Test File**: Consider moving `modules/demographics/genealogy/tests/test_genealogy.py` to `tests/unit/modules/demographics/genealogy/test_genealogy.py` to align with the `ARCH_TESTS.md` consolidation plan.
*   **Lazy Import Pattern**: The usage of `from server import sim` inside `get_genealogy_service` (`router.py`) is a pragmatic workaround for circular dependencies but introduces a hidden coupling to the global `server` module.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**:
    > "The router uses a dependency injection pattern (`get_genealogy_service`) to access the global simulation state safely, handling potential import cycles via runtime imports."
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**:
    > The insight accurately highlights the circular dependency challenge between FastAPI routers and the main `simulation` instance. The solution (lazy import) is effective but technically constitutes "Global State Access" rather than pure Dependency Injection. The report correctly identifies that Zero-Sum integrity is preserved via read-only operations.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
*   **Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`
*   **Draft Content**:
    ```markdown
    | TD-API-LAZY-IMPORT | API/Router | **Lazy Global Import**: Routers (e.g., `genealogy`) lazy-import `sim` from `server.py` to avoid circular deps. Hides coupling. | **Low**: Architecture Hygiene. | Open |
    ```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The PR is solid. The logic is isolated, DTOs are pure, and tests are well-written (adhering to Mock Purity rules by setting primitive attributes on `MagicMock`). The test location deviation is minor and does not warrant blocking the PR.
