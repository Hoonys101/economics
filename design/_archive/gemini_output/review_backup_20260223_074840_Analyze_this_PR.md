Here is the Code Review Report for the `forensics_hardening_phase2` PR.

# 🕵️ Gemini CLI Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR refactors core financial data structures (`LoanDTO`, `DepositDTO`, `FXMatchDTO`, `TransactionContext`) from `TypedDict` to strict `@dataclass` implementations to improve type safety and immutability. Crucially, it patches a **critical hyper-inflation bug** in the corporate tax system where tax liability was erroneously multiplied by 100.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None found in the provided diff. The security and zero-sum checks pass.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Missing Test File**: The insight report mentions creating `tests/modules/government/taxation/test_corporate_tax_bug.py` as proof of the fix, but this file is **not present in the PR diff**. While the fix itself (`* 100` removal) is visibly correct, the regression test artifact must be committed to prevent future regressions.

## 💡 Suggestions
1.  **Commit the Missing Test**: Please `git add tests/modules/government/taxation/test_corporate_tax_bug.py` and amend the commit.
2.  **DTO Defaults**: In `LoanDTO`, `due_tick` is optional (`= None`). Ensure `LoanBookingEngine` or the `Bank` correctly calculates/sets this if it's `None` during instantiation to avoid `TypeError` in comparisons later (e.g., `if current_tick > loan.due_tick`).

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: Defined in `communications/insights/forensics_hardening_phase2.md`.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: **High Value**. The detection of the `* 100` corporate tax bug is a critical catch. This likely explains a significant portion of "unexplained inflation" or "money creation" observed in previous runs. The move to `@dataclass` for `TransactionContext` significantly hardens the `TransactionProcessor` against mutation bugs.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
### ID: TD-GOV-TAX-HYPERINFLATION
- **Title**: Corporate Tax Calculation 100x Inflation
- **Symptom**: Corporate tax amounts were multiplied by 100 *after* already being converted to pennies.
- **Risk**: CRITICAL. Massive magic money creation causing systemic inflation.
- **Solution**: Removed erroneous multiplier in `generate_corporate_tax_intents`.
- **Status**: RESOLVED (Phase 2)
```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

*(Note: The logic fix is critical and correct. The missing test file is a minor hygiene issue that should be addressed in the next commit, but does not block this urgent fix.)*
