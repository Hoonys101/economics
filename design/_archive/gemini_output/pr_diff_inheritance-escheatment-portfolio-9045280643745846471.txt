+# Insight: TD-160 Inheritance & TD-192 Audit
+
+## 1. Inheritance Manager Fix (TD-160)
+The current `InheritanceManager` correctly creates a `LegacySettlementAccount` which captures the deceased's portfolio. However, the escheatment logic (transfer to Government when no heirs) relies on `SettlementSystem.execute_settlement` iterating over the `distribution_plan` to find the Government.
+
+**Issue**: If the deceased has 0 cash, `InheritanceManager` adds nothing to `distribution_plan` (because `if cash > 0`). Consequently, `SettlementSystem.execute_settlement` has an empty plan to iterate over, and the loop that checks `if account.is_escheatment` and triggers `recipient.receive_portfolio` is never entered.
+
+**Solution**: Force the Government into the `distribution_plan` (with 0.0 cash) when there are no heirs, even if cash is 0. This ensures `SettlementSystem` visits the Government entry and triggers the portfolio transfer.
+
+## 2. ActionProcessor Refactor (TD-192 / Task 2)
+The task requested replacing direct asset modifications in `ActionProcessor` with `SettlementSystem` calls.
+An audit of `ActionProcessor` (wrapper) and `TransactionProcessor` (dispatcher) and its handlers (`FinancialTransactionHandler`, `AssetTransferHandler`, `MonetaryHandler`, `StockTransactionHandler`, `GovernmentSpendingHandler`) revealed that **they already use `SettlementSystem`**.
+- `settlement_system.transfer(...)` and `settlement_system.settle_atomic(...)` are consistently used for cash/value transfers.
+- Direct property modification (`.assets +=`) was not found in these handlers (except for read operations).
+- Direct modification of `shares_owned` (inventory) in `StockTransactionHandler` is appropriate as `SettlementSystem` handles cash, while handlers manage specific asset registries (unless using `receive_portfolio` which is specific to inheritance).
+
+**Conclusion**: No refactoring of `ActionProcessor` is required as it complies with the requirement. The "audit" mentioned in the task draft likely referred to confirming this state or referred to `TickOrchestrator` (which the draft recommended NOT refactoring).
