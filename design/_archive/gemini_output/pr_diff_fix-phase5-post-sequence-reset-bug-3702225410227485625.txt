+# Phase 6 Stabilization Verification Report
+
+## 1. Issue Description
+A `TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable` was reported, caused by `expenses_this_tick` being reset to `0.0` (float) instead of a dictionary. This prevented multi-currency expenses from being recorded in subsequent ticks.
+
+## 2. Verification of Fix
+We have verified that the codebase currently implements the correct fix:
+- **Component**: `FinanceDepartment.finalize_tick()` in `simulation/components/finance_department.py`.
+- **Logic**: Resets `expenses_this_tick` and `revenue_this_tick` to `{self.primary_currency: 0.0}`.
+- **Orchestration**: `Phase5_PostSequence` in `simulation/orchestration/phases/post_sequence.py` correctly delegates the reset to `finalize_tick()`.
+
+## 3. Enhancements
+To prevent regression and improve debuggability:
+- **Robustness**: Added a warning log in `Phase5_PostSequence` if an active firm lacks the `finalize_tick` method.
+- **Documentation**: Added comments explicitly stating that `finalize_tick` handles the multi-currency reset.
+
+## 4. Technical Debt
+- **Heuristic Summation**: `FinanceDepartment.finalize_tick` sums `expenses_this_tick.values()` without exchange rates to calculate `last_daily_expenses`. This is a known trade-off for performance/simplicity in the absence of an injected `ExchangeService`.
+- **Mock Dependencies**: Verification tests relied on extensive mocking of `SimulationState` due to high coupling. Future refactoring should aim to decouple `Phase5_PostSequence` from `SimulationState` or provide easier test harnesses.
+
+## 5. Conclusion
+The reported crash is not reproducible in the current codebase state. The fix is verified and robust.
