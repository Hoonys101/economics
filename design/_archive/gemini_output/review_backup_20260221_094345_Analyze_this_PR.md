# Code Review Report: Firm Architecture Overhaul (Wave 2.1)

## 🔍 Summary
This PR standardizes the `Firm` agent's core engines (`SalesEngine`, `HREngine`, `FinanceEngine`) to strictly use integer-based penny arithmetic for all internal logic and settlement. It eliminates the dangerous ambiguity between float dollars and integer pennies that caused inflation bugs. Additionally, it enforces strict type safety by making all engines explicitly implement their respective Protocols (`IFinanceEngine`, `IHREngine`, etc.).

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*None detected.*

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Ambiguity in `post_ask` Overload**: The `Firm.post_ask` method now accepts `float | int`. While this provides backward compatibility, it relies on type checking (`isinstance(price, float)`) to determine currency units (Dollars vs. Pennies). This could be risky if a caller accidentally passes a float representation of pennies (e.g., `1000.0`). Long-term, this should be replaced with a strictly typed `Money` object or separate methods.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Deprecate Float Inputs**: Consider adding a `DeprecationWarning` when `post_ask` is called with a float, to encourage migration to integer pennies across the codebase.
*   **Update Downstream Consumers**: Ensure that any systems consuming `state.last_prices` (e.g., Dashboard, Analytics, Heuristic Agents) are aware that values are now stored as pennies (integers), not dollars (floats).

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: `communications/insights/wave2-firm-architecture.md` correctly identifies the "Penny/Dollar Ambiguity" as a major source of bugs and the need for "Strict Penny Arithmetic".
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight is accurate and critical. The decision to separate "Display Value" (float) from "Settlement Value" (int) in `Transaction` objects is a robust pattern that should be applied globally. The "Legacy Logic Leaks" point is also valid and addressed.

### ID: TD-ARCH-FIRM-PENNY
- **Title**: Firm Engine Penny Standardization
- **Symptom**: `Firm` engines previously mixed float (dollars) and int (pennies), causing 100x inflation bugs.
- **Risk**: Critical Financial Integrity.
- **Solution**: Enforce strict integer arithmetic in all Firm engines (`Sales`, `HR`, `Finance`). Float is only for display.
- **Status**: **RESOLVED** (Wave 2.1: Implemented in `Firm` architecture overhaul).
