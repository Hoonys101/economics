# Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR enforces **Zero-Sum Integrity** by migrating `MAManager` (Mergers & Acquisitions) and `StockMatchingEngine` from floating-point arithmetic (dollars) to integer arithmetic (pennies). It refactors settlement calls to ensure only integer amounts are transferred and adds comprehensive unit tests to verify type safety during friendly mergers, hostile takeovers, and bankruptcy liquidations.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*None detected.*

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   **Ambiguous Capital Valuation in Bankruptcy**:
    *   **Location**: `simulation/systems/ma_manager.py:248` (`_execute_bankruptcy`)
    *   **Issue**: `capital_value_pennies = int(firm.capital_stock * 100)` relies on the assumption that `capital_stock` represents a dollar value (float) where $1.0 = 100 pennies, or that 1 unit of capital is worth exactly $1.00.
    *   **Risk**: The code comment itself admits uncertainty: `# Assuming 1 unit of capital = $1 ? Or verify?`. If `capital_stock` is tracked in pennies (like `wallet`), this multiplication inflates value by 100x. If it is a unit quantity without a price, the valuation is arbitrary.
    *   **Requirement**: Verify the unit of `Firm.capital_stock`. If it is a physical quantity, it should be multiplied by a price (e.g., `avg_price` of capital goods) rather than a hardcoded factor.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Explicit Price Resolution**: Instead of `int(firm.capital_stock * 100)`, verify if "Capital" exists as a tradeable good in `goods.json`. If so, look up its market price similar to how inventory value is calculated (`m.avg_price`).
*   **Test Fixture Hardening**: The new tests use manual `MagicMock` setup for `Firm`. While acceptable for this focused fix, consider using `golden_firms` fixture in future iterations to ensure `valuation` and `capital_stock` relationships mirror production reality.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation

> **Original Insight**: "Refactored `_execute_merger` to accept `price: int`. Updated `process_market_exits_and_entries` ... to calculate `offer_price` in pennies ... Constraint: `SettlementSystem.transfer` ... strictly enforce integer arguments."

**Reviewer Evaluation**:
The insight accurately captures the architectural friction between the floating-point logic of `MAManager` (valuation models) and the integer-based `SettlementSystem`. It correctly identifies the resolution pattern (Calculate in Float -> Cast to Int -> Settle). The documentation of the bankruptcy fix (recovered cash type mismatch) is also valuable for future debugging.

## 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)

**Target File**: `design/2_operations/ledgers/TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`

```markdown
| **TD-CRIT-FLOAT-MA** | Finance | **M&A Float Violation**: `MAManager` and `StockMarket` calculate and transfer `float` values. | **Critical**: Type Error. | **Resolved** |
```

## ✅ Verdict
**APPROVE**

The changes successfully mitigate the Critical Zero-Sum violation (`TD-CRIT-FLOAT-MA`). The logic for converting merger prices to pennies is sound. The ambiguity regarding `capital_stock` valuation in bankruptcy is noted as a logic gap but does not block the primary objective of preventing crashes during settlement transfers. The added tests provide sufficient evidence of the fix.
