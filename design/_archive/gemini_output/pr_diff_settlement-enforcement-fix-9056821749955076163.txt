+# Mission Insight: Settlement Enforcement (2026-02-03)
+
+## Overview
+This mission addresses critical financial integrity violations identified in `report_20260203_100305...md`. The goal is to enforce the usage of `SettlementSystem` for all asset transfers and eliminate direct manipulation of agent assets ("magic money").
+
+## Identified Violations
+
+### 1. `FinanceDepartment` Bypasses
+- **Violation**: `issue_shares` and `add_liability` methods in `simulation/components/finance_department.py` directly modify the firm's cash balance via `self.credit()`.
+- **Impact**: This creates money out of thin air. For `issue_shares`, it duplicates the cash inflow if the Stock Market also executes a transaction. For `add_liability`, it adds cash without a corresponding withdrawal from a lender.
+- **Fix**: Remove `self.credit()` calls from these methods. They should only update the share count or debt record. Cash must be transferred via `SettlementSystem` transactions (e.g., stock purchase, loan disbursement).
+
+### 2. Direct Asset Modification in Agents
+- **Violation**: `Bank`, `Government`, and `BaseAgent` expose `_add_assets` and `_sub_assets` methods which are intended for internal use but are public enough to be abused (as noted in audits like `TD105_DRIFT_FORENSICS`).
+- **Impact**: Allows any system (e.g., `EconomicRefluxSystem`, legacy `HousingSystem`) to inject or remove money without a transaction record, breaking the Zero-Sum principle.
+- **Fix**: Rename these methods to `_internal_add_assets` and `_internal_sub_assets`. Update the public `deposit` and `withdraw` methods (mandated by `IFinancialEntity`) to call these internal methods. This forces all external callers to use `deposit`/`withdraw`, which are the standard entry points for `SettlementSystem`.
+
+### 3. `CentralBank` Asset Logic
+- **Violation**: `CentralBank` logic for `deposit` and `withdraw` directly modifies internal dictionary structures. While not strictly a violation if used correctly, it should follow the same pattern as other agents for consistency.
+- **Fix**: Ensure strict encapsulation.
+
+## Strategic Plan
+The refactoring will proceed by:
+1.  **Sanitizing Components**: Stripping `FinanceDepartment` of its magic money powers.
+2.  **Hardening Agents**: Renaming internal asset modification methods to break any unauthorized external dependencies.
+3.  **Verifying Integrity**: Using static analysis (`grep`) to ensure no direct asset modification remains.
+
+This ensures that the `SettlementSystem` becomes the sole authority for financial transfers, as it operates exclusively through the `IFinancialEntity.deposit/withdraw` interface which generates the necessary audit trails.
