+# Structural Fix: Government Singleton/List Mismatch
+
+## Architectural Insights
+- **Issue**: The `Government` agent was treated as a singleton in some contexts (`sim.government`) but the underlying storage `WorldState` was moving towards a list-based approach (`self.governments`) to support potential multi-government scenarios or just cleaner structure.
+- **Resolution**: Implemented the "Property Proxy" pattern in `WorldState`.
+  - `WorldState.governments` (List) is the Single Source of Truth.
+  - `WorldState.government` (Property) acts as a proxy to `self.governments[0]`.
+  - `WorldState.government.setter` ensures writes are synchronized with the list.
+- **Initialization**: Refactored `SimulationInitializer` to explicitly append the government instance to `sim.world_state.governments` instead of relying on implicit setters.
+
+## Test Evidence
+```
+tests/unit/test_government_structure.py::TestGovernmentStructure::test_government_property_proxy PASSED [ 33%]
+tests/unit/test_government_structure.py::TestGovernmentStructure::test_government_setter_sync PASSED [ 66%]
+tests/unit/test_government_structure.py::TestGovernmentStructure::test_simulation_delegation PASSED [100%]
+```
+
+## Unrelated Failures Note
+During verification, pre-existing failures were observed in `tests/unit/modules/watchtower/test_agent_service.py` related to missing `pydantic` in the test environment and insufficient mocking in `conftest.py`. These were confirmed to persist even after reverting changes, indicating they are unrelated to this fix.
