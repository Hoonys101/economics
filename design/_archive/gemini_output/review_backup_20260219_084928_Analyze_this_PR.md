# 🐙 Gemini CLI System Prompt: Git Reviewer

## 🔍 Summary
This PR decomposes the monolithic `LifecycleManager` into three focused systems: `BirthSystem`, `AgingSystem`, and `DeathSystem`. It enforces the "Sacred Sequence" by ensuring `BirthSystem` returns `Transaction` objects instead of executing side-effects directly. Additionally, it hardens type safety by introducing `IAgingFirm` protocols and enforces **Integer Math** for all financial comparisons (e.g., liquidity crunch checks).

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*None detected.*

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*None detected.* The refactoring preserves existing logic logic while improving architectural hygiene (State/Engine separation, Integer Math).

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Semantic Clarity on "Needs"**: In `AgingSystem`, `liquidity_need` (0-100 float) is multiplied by 100 to compare with assets in pennies. While this preserves the mathematical ratio of the previous implementation, semantically comparing a "Need Score" to "Pennies" is slightly ambiguous. Consider future refactoring to explicitly define `liquidity_threshold_pennies`.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: The author identified that `MagicMock` struggles with `runtime_checkable` Protocols (specifically `isinstance` checks) and `__getattr__` usage, leading to brittle tests. They adopted a "Fake Object" (`MockFirm`) pattern.
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: **High Value**. This is a recurring pain point in Python Protocol-based architectures. The shift from `MagicMock` to lightweight "Fakes" (Dataclasses or simple classes) for core domain objects is a best practice that significantly improves test robustness and readability. This insight should be codified in our testing standards.

### 6. Protocol Mocking Strategy (The "Fake" Rule)
- **Challenge**: `MagicMock` interacts poorly with `@runtime_checkable` Protocols. `isinstance(mock, MyProtocol)` often returns false negatives or requires complex `spec` configurations that drift from reality.
- **Rule**: When testing logic that relies heavily on Protocol checks (e.g., `isinstance(agent, IAgingFirm)`), prefer using **Fake Objects** (simple classes/dataclasses) over `MagicMock`.
    - **Why**: Fakes provide concrete, type-safe attributes that satisfy the Protocol contract naturally without `spec` hacking.
    - **Example**: Instead of `mock_firm = MagicMock(spec=IAgingFirm)`, define `class FakeFirm: ...` in the test file with the required fields.
