# 🐙 Code Review Report

## 🔍 Summary
This PR successfully hardens the Reporting and Analytics layer by migrating key monetary fields from `float` to `int` (Pennies), ensuring precision in persistence and observation. It updates the database schema (`REAL` -> `INTEGER`), DTO definitions, and the `AnalyticsSystem` to support the "Penny Standard", addressing the **Reporting Leakage** technical debt.

## 🚨 Critical Issues
*   None detected.

## ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
*   None detected. The changes strictly adhere to the "Integer Pennies" architectural guardrail.

## 💡 Suggestions
*   **Defensive Casting**: In `simulation/orchestration/dashboard_service.py`, explicit `int()` casting is used (e.g., `m2_leak=int(m2_leak)`). Ensure that the source values (`state.integrity.m2_leak`) are indeed integers or float-integers to avoid truncation of legitimate fractional cents if any remain in the upstream calculation (though they shouldn't).
*   **Transaction Purity**: In `simulation/systems/analytics_system.py`, `getattr(tx, 'total_pennies', 0)` is used. While safe, ensure that the upstream `Transaction` model creation logic (in `MatchingEngine` or `TransactionProcessor`) guarantees the population of `total_pennies` to avoid defaulting to `0` for valid transactions.

## 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
*   **Original Insight**: *[exec-dto-reporting-pennies.md]* "We have successfully hardened the Reporting DTOs to strictly use integer pennies for all monetary values... This eliminates floating-point drift in persisted data and analytics."
*   **Reviewer Evaluation**: The insight accurately reflects the scope of the PR. It correctly identifies the DTOs and DB schema changes. It marks a critical step in the "Penny Standard" migration, moving from "Operational Purity" (logic) to "Observational Purity" (reporting).

```markdown
| **TD-DTO-RED-ZONE** | DTO/API | **Reporting Leakage**: `api.py` DTOs heavily float-based for analytics/export. | **High**: Reporting Inaccuracy. | **Resolved** |
