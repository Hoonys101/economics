# Code Review Report

### 🔍 Summary
The provided diff is empty. It contains no code modifications, test evidence, or the mandatory implementation insight report. The submission is incomplete and does not meet the minimum requirements for a review.

### 🚨 Critical Issues
- **Missing Implementation Insight Report**: The PR Diff does not include the required `communications/insights/[Mission_Key].md` file. As per protocol, any and all implementation work must be accompanied by an insight report to document learnings and technical debt. This is a primary deliverable and its absence is a critical failure.
- **No Evidence of Work**: There are no code changes or test results, making it impossible to review what was done.

### ⚠️ Logic & Spec Gaps
- Not applicable as no code was provided.

### 💡 Suggestions
- Not applicable.

### 🧠 Implementation Insight Evaluation
- **Original Insight**: [None Provided]
- **Reviewer Evaluation**: A mandatory insight report was not submitted. It is essential to document the findings from any task, including the root cause analysis of the "engine-purity-and-type-errors" mission this PR appears related to. Without this document, crucial knowledge is lost, and the team cannot learn from the debugging process.

### 📚 Manual Update Proposal (Draft)
- **Target File**: Not applicable.
- **Draft Content**: Not applicable as no insight was provided.

### ✅ Verdict
**REQUEST CHANGES (Hard-Fail)**

Reasoning: The submission is incomplete. The most critical failure is the omission of the mandatory insight report (`communications/insights/*.md`) in the PR diff. Furthermore, no code changes or test evidence were included. The PR must be updated to include all required artifacts before a review can proceed.
