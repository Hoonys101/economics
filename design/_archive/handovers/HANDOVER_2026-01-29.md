# Handover Report: 2026-01-29
**Session: Clean Room Era - Architecture Consolidation**

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved
1.  **PR Merged: Phenomena Reporting (WO-154)**: 
    *   Refactored `stress_test_perfect_storm.py` into a modular phenomena-based reporting system.
    *   Transitioned from binary "Pass/Fail" results to sophisticated Resilience Indices and targeted detectors.
2.  **Architecture Re-mapping**:
    *   Decomposed the monolithic `platform_architecture.md` into a Master Index linked to 5 domain-specific detailed documents (`Sacred Sequence`, `Financial Integrity`, `Agent Value Systems`, etc.).
    *   Established the **"Spec-Architecture Rule"** in `QUICKSTART.md` to ensure design documents precede implementation.
3.  **Tooling Refinement**:
    *   Debugged and updated `cmd_ops.py` to support all `gemini_worker.py` types.
    *   Simplified operational guides in `QUICKSTART.md` for better developer UX. 
4.  **Documentation Hygiene**:
    *   Purged orphan and redundant documentation (`AGENTS.md`, `OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md`).
    *   Created folder-level indices for `1_governance`, `2_operations`, and `3_work_artifacts`.
    *   Transformed root `README.md` into a professional outward-facing project portal.

## 🛠️ Technical Changes
*   **Merged**: `remotes/origin/phenomena-reporting-wo154-16652174254193131094`
*   **New Specs**: `SPEC_STORM_PHENOMENA_REPORTING.md`
*   **New Architecture Docs**: `ARCH_SEQUENCING.md`, `ARCH_TRANSACTIONS.md`, `ARCH_AGENTS.md`, `ARCH_AI_ENGINE.md`, `ARCH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`.
*   **Tech Debt**: Recorded and repayment planned for **TD-154** (Closed) and **TD-155** (Active - Jules logic refinement).

## 🚀 Next Steps
1.  **Execute Specialized Stress Tests**: Run `python scripts/run_phenomena_analysis.py --scenario config/scenarios/stress_test_phenomena.yaml` to verify the new reporting output.
2.  **Address TD-155**: Refactor `_calculate_policy_synergy` in `phenomena_analyzer.py` to use structured `details` instead of message strings.
3.  **Visualization Enhancement**: Develop `analysis/plot_phenomena_report.py` to visualize the outcomes of the new detectors as planned in the spec.

## 📡 Mission Status
- **Gemini**: Resting. Missions cleared.
- **Jules**: Implementation of WO-154 complete and merged.
