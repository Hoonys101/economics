# Handover Report: 2026-01-26

## 1. Session Summary
This session addressed a critical agent viability issue where newborn agents were being created without initial needs, leading to immediate inactivity and culling (DOA). We also initiated but deferred a larger cleanup of the test suite strategy.

## 2. Key Achievements
- **Newborn Agent Initialization Fix** ✅
 - **Problem**: Newborn agents had empty `initial_needs` dicts, causing "apathy" (no motivation to act).
 - **Solution**: Implemented `NEWBORN_INITIAL_NEEDS` injection in `DemographicManager`.
 - **Architecture**: Externalized need values to `config/economy_params.yaml` (No magic numbers).
 - **Verification**: Added robust unit tests mocking the simulation context.
- **AGENTS.md Update**: Documented the "Principle: All Agents are Born with Purpose".

## 3. Deferred / Pending Items
- **Test Directory Refactoring** ⏸️ (Deferred)
 - The `tests/` directory remains cluttered. A cleanup plan exists but execution was paused to prioritize feature stability.
- **Track Alpha: Tick 1 Money Leak (-99k)** ⏸️ (Pending)
 - **TD-115** remains unresolved. A spec was drafted but not implemented. M2 money supply calculation still has initial drift.

## 4. Pending Tasks & Risks
- **Asset Leak**: The -99,680 drift at Tick 1 (TD-115) needs to be addressed in the next session to ensure perfect zero-sum integrity from $t=0$.
- **Test Integrity**: The test suite is functional but disorganized. Future refactoring is needed to separate Unit, Integration, and E2E tests.

## 5. Next Session Directive
1. **Solve TD-115**: Prioritize fixing the Tick 1 Money Leak (Track Alpha).
2. **Resume "Great Reset"**: Continue with **Step 2 (Abstraction Wall)** for DTO purity as originally planned in the previous handover.
3. **Monitor Newborns**: Verify that population growth is sustainable and newborns effectively enter the workforce.

**Status:** Session Closed. Stability Improved.
