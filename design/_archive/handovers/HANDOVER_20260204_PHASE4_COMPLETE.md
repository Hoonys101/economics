# Handover Report: Operation Leviathan (Phase 4 Completion)

**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Role**: Antigravity (Architectural Assistant)
**To**: Lead Architect
**Subject**: Phase 4 Summary & Phase 5 Transition

## 1. 🚀 Executive Summary: Operation Leviathan

Phase 4 has been successfully concluded. We have successfully transitioned from a monolithic agent architecture to a decoupled, protocol-driven system with an integrated political AI "Brain". The simulation maintains theoretical financial integrity (**0.0000 Money Leak**) while supporting complex multi-currency transactions and partisan political governance.

## 2. 🏛️ Key Implementation Milestones

### 🧠 Political & AI Layer (Phase 4-B)
- **AdaptiveGovBrain (WO-4.5)**: A stateless, utility-driven engine that ranks policies based on partisan ideology (RED: Equality, BLUE: Growth).
- **PoliticalComponent (WO-4.3)**: Integrated voter demographics with ideological sensitivities (Trust, Equality, Growth).
- **PolicyLockout (WO-4.4)**: Implemented "School of Thought" cooling periods (20 ticks) for sacked advisors.
- **Verification (WO-4.6)**: Validated "Scapegoat" and "Support Paradox" scenarios under extreme economic stress.

### 🏗️ Structural Foundation (Phase 4-A)
- **Wallet Abstraction (WO-4.2A)**: Unified asset management via `Wallet` class, removing naked `float` manipulation in agents.
- **Orchestrator Alignment (WO-4.2B)**: Standardized post-phase hook for all simulation components to ensure deterministic synchronization.
- **Saga Pipeline (WO-4.8/10)**: Refactored Loans and Liquidation into SRP-compliant handlers with asynchronous Saga support.
- **Decoupling (Drafted/Spec'd)**: Promoted specifications for Household Mixins and Market Protocols to eliminate the "God Class" pattern.

## 3. 🛡️ Financial Integrity & Infrastructure
- **Multi-Currency (TD-213)**: Full audit complete; `Transaction` and `Housing` layers now multi-currency aware.
- **Ledger Automation (TD-150)**: Integrated Git hooks to automatically track TODO-based technical debt and archive resolved items.
- **Precision (TD-206)**: Standardized mortgage DTOs to handle high-precision interest calculations without floating-point drift.

## 4. ⚠️ Remaining Risks & Technical Debt (The "Next Target")

The documentation audit (TD-188/193) identified a new cluster of critical debts in the **Government Module**:
- **TD-226/227**: Circular dependencies between `simulation.agents.Government` and its internal components.
- **TD-228**: `WelfareManager` SRP violation (handling Tax, Welfare, and Stimulus).
- **TD-229**: Low unit test coverage in the newly expanded political logic.

## 5. 🔭 Roadmap: Phase 5 (Interbank Markets)
With the domestic Welfare State anchored, the next cycle will focus on:
1. **Interbank Settlement**: Implementation of reserve requirements and Overnight Repo markets.
2. **Systemic Risk Monitor**: Expanding the `BubbleObservatory` into a full macro-prudential regulator.
3. **Decoupling Government**: Resolving the newly identified Gov-module debts (TD-226~229).
