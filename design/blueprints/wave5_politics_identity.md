# Blueprint: Identity Economics & Political Orchestration (Roadmap)

## 🎭 1. Identity Economics (The Utility of Self-Esteem)

### 1.1 Conceptual Goal
Shift from "Homo Economicus" (material only) to "Identity Agents" who value their social standing and self-worth ($U_{id}$) as much as consumption ($U_{cons}$).

### 1.2 The Total Utility Function
$U = f(U_{cons}, U_{id})$
*   **$U_{cons}$:** Utility from consuming goods (Bread, Luxury).
*   **$U_{id}$:** Utility from **Self-Esteem (자존감)**.
    - **Source:** Degree validation, Wage-to-Peer comparison, Employment status.
    - **Impact:** High education graduates with low-tier wages suffer a total Utility collapse even if they can afford food.

## 🏛️ 2. The Political Market (Political Economy)

### 2.1 The Shift to Politics
When $U_{id}$ is crushed by the economic market (e.g., the Education Bubble burst), agents stop trying to "Skill Up" and start trying to **"Rule Up"**.

### 2.2 Rent-Seeking & Lobbying (지대 추구)
*   **Mechanism:** High-education but Low-productivity agents demand political barriers.
*   **Implementation:** 
    - **Licensing (면허):** Restricting certain `IndustryDomains` to only those with specific `Degrees` or `Certifications`.
    - **Quotas:** Mandatory minimum wages for "Professionals" regardless of actual productivity.
*   **Economic Impact:** Artificial shortage created by political force to protect the $U_{id}$ of the elites.

### 2.3 Voting & Populism
*   **The Voting Engine:** Agents vote for policies that maximize their $U_{total}$. 
*   **Populist Trap:** Agents in "Despair" vote for massive subsidies or protectionism to restore their social pride, even at the cost of long-term GDP.

## 🛠️ Components of the `PoliticalOrchestrator`

| Component | Responsibility | Implementation Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IdentityModule** | Utility Scaling | Calculate $U_{id}$ based on `Experience`, `Major`, and `SocialComparison`. |
| **LobbyingEngine** | Structural Distortion | Inject "License Required" flags into `FirmConfigDTO` based on political pressure. |
| **BallotSystem** | Voting Logic | Agents select `PoliticalPolicyDTO` that buffers their current "Identity Pain." |
| **Legislator** | Policy Enforcement | Update `GovernmentConfig` (Taxes, Subsidies, Entry Barriers) per tick. |

## 📈 Emergent Scenarios to Watch
*   **The Professional Gatekeeper:** Experienced doctors/lawyers lobbying to restrict new graduates to keep wages high.
*   **The Graduate Revolt:** Unemployed graduates voting for "Education Relief" or "Guaranteed Professional Jobs," leading to hyper-inflation or government debt bubbles.
*   **The Pride Paradox:** Agents refusing welfare because it kills their $U_{id}$ (Stigma), leading to starvation despite available funds.
