The USER has requested the implementation of Phase 29: The Great Depression Simulation.

## Context
We have verified the Altman Z-Score implementation (TD-008) and Behavioral Economics (Phase 28).
Now, we must test the system under extreme stress conditions to verify the "Crash" mechanics.

## Mission
1.  **Scenario Configuration**: Create `config/scenarios/phase29_depression.json` to simulate increased interest rates and taxes ("Black Thursday").
2.  **Crisis Monitor**: Implement `modules/analysis/crisis_monitor.py` to track firm solvency (safe/gray/distress) over time.
3.  **Integration**: Hook the monitor into the `Simulation` loop in `engine.py`.

## Reference
Please strictly follow the specification in: `design/specs/phase29_depression_spec.md`.

## Output
- A PR containing the new scenario, the monitor module, and the engine integration.
- A report on the Z-Score sensitivity observed during your local tests.
