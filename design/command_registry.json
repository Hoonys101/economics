Generate a comprehensive report with two sections:\n\n1. **Wrapper Properties Inventory**: List all @property getters/setters in simulation/firms.py that simply delegate to internal components (e.g., hr, finance). For each wrapper, identify:\n   - Property name\n   - Target component and attribute\n   - Number of external usages (grep count)\n   - Breaking change risk (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)\n\n2. **CorporateManager Coupling Analysis**: Analyze simulation/decisions/corporate_manager.py to identify all direct state manipulations of Firm objects. For each coupling point:\n   - Method name in CorporateManager\n   - Direct attribute access pattern (e.g., 'firm.assets -= budget')\n   - Proposed encapsulation method (e.g., 'firm.invest_in_automation(amount)')\n   - Impact on existing tests\n\nReference TD-065_Household_Refactor_Spec.md as a template for the refactoring approach. Output should be a detailed spec document ready for Jules implementation.",
