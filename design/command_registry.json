Proof of resolution: How initialization reordering eliminated the Tick 1 leak.\n2. Architectural Purity: How converting Government/Education spending to deferred Transactions and using SystemEffectsManager handlers enforced the Sacred Sequence.\n3. Financial Integrity: Confirmation that all fixes maintain zero-sum stability as per the Gold Standard (WO-016).\n\nOutput should be saved to design/gemini_output/CONSOLIDATED_RESOLUTION_REPORT.md.",
