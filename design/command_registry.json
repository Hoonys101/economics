Goal: Decompose the Household class into modular sub-components based on the Bio-Econ-Social model to reduce complexity and improve testability. Required Components: 1) BioComponent (ReproductionComponent): Move mitosis logic and state cloning. 2) EconComponent: Unified ConsumptionStrategy and LaborComponent (wage stickiness, job search). 3) SocialComponent: Political opinion, social status, and rank logic. Strict Requirements: Use DTOs for inter-component communication, decouple DecisionEngine using DecisionDTO, and maintain compatibility with Golden Fixtures.
