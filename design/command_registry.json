Goal: Decompose the 900+ LoC Simulation class (simulation/engine.py) into specialized managers following the SoC (Separation of Concerns) principle. Recommended Components: 1) TickScheduler: Handles the time loop and system update sequencing. 2) WorldState: Manages agent registries and global snapshots. 3) PersistenceManager: Handles DB flushing and serialization. 4) AgentLifecycleManager: Manages agent creation, death, and IPO/SEO triggers. Strict Requirements: Maintain backward compatibility with app.py/main.py entry points, use DTOs for inter-component state passing, and ensure 100% test pass for Phase 29 scenarios. Follow design/manuals/spec_writer.md.",
