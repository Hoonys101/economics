## 1. 현재 개발 단계

- **현재 단계:**
    - **`Phase 15: Architectural Lockdown (Zero Tolerance Protocol Enforcement)`** 🚨 **[ACTIVE]**
        - **Goal**: Halt all feature development to conduct a project-wide audit and remediation sprint. This phase focuses on **enforcement** of existing protocols, not new refactoring. The goal is to make architectural violations impossible to compile or run.
        - **Status**:
            - [ ] **Track A (Static Enforcement)**: Implement static analysis tools (e.g., custom `ruff` rules) to detect and fail builds on direct private member access (e.g., `.inventory`, `.cash`) from outside authorized modules/engines.
            - [ ] **Track B (Runtime Enforcement)**: Instrument protocol boundaries with runtime checks (`@runtime_checkable` or decorators) that log or raise exceptions on non-compliant calls during testing.
            - [x] **Track C (Audit & Remediate)**: Liquidated critical integrity debts (Lifecycle, Inventory, Finance) via Triple-Debt Bundle. ✅
            - [x] **Track D**: **Phase 15.2: SEO Hardening & Finance Purity (Functional Lockdown)**. ✅ (2026-02-12)
            - [x] **Track E (Test Restoration)**: Fully migrated test suite to SettlementSystem SSoT (580 Passed). ✅
            - [x] **Track G (Parity & Integrity Audit)**: Collected and verified reports from remote branches. Discovered gaps in Sim Cockpit Frontend. ✅
            - [ ] **Track F (Policy & Documentation)**: Update `QUICKSTART.md` and contribution guidelines to explicitly forbid direct access.

    - **`Phase 15.2: SEO Hardening & Finance Purity (Functional Lockdown)`** 🛡️ ✅ (2026-02-12)
        - **Achievement**: Enforced "Stateless Engine & Orchestrator" (SEO) pattern across core systems.
        - **Status**:
            - [x] **SEO Hardening**: Refactored `TaxService` and `FinanceSystem` to use DTO Snapshots. ✅
            - [x] **Finance Purity**: Enforced `State_In -> State_Out` pattern in debt and loan engines. ✅
            - [x] **QE Restoration**: Restored Quantitative Easing logic and enabled related tests. ✅
            - [x] **Verification**: 100% test pass rate (580/580) with zero architectural leaks. 💎 ✅

    - **`Phase 15.1: Critical Liquidation Sprint (Triple-Debt Bundle)`** 🛡️ ✅ (2026-02-12)
        - **Achievement**: Systematically eliminated the most severe architectural violations threatening financial and data integrity.
        - **Status**:
            - [x] **Lifecycle Pulse**: Implemented `HouseholdFactory` and `reset_tick_state` to enforce "Late-Reset" and Zero-Sum birth. ✅
            - [x] **Inventory Slot Protocol**: Standardized multi-slot inventory management; eliminated `Registry` duplication. ✅
            - [x] **Financial Fortress**: Enforced `SettlementSystem` as absolute SSoT; removed parallel ledgers; locked down agent wallets. ✅
            - [x] **Test Restoration**: Finalized 100% test pass rate post-migration (575 Passed). ✅
            - [x] **Verification**: Zero-sum integrity confirmed across births, transactions, and state transitions. 💎 ✅

    - **`Phase 14: The Great Agent Decomposition (Refactoring Era)`** 💎 ✅ (2026-02-11)
        - **Achievement**: Completed the total transition of core agents (Household, Firm, Finance) to the Orchestrator-Engine pattern, dismantling the last God Classes.
        - **Status**:
            - [x] **Household Decomposition**: Extracted Lifecycle, Needs, Budget, and Consumption engines. ✅
            - [x] **Firm Decomposition**: Extracted Production, Asset Management, and R&D engines. ✅
            - [x] **Finance Refactoring**: Implemented `FinancialLedgerDTO` as SSoT and stateless booking/servicing engines. ✅
            - [x] **Protocol Alignment**: Standardized `IInventoryHandler` and `ICollateralizableAsset` protocols. ✅
            - [x] **Verification**: Final structural audit confirmed 100% architectural compliance and 0.0000% leakage integrity. 💎 ✅

    - **`Phase 13: Total Test Suite Restoration (The Final Stand)`** 🛡️ ✅ (2026-02-12 업데이트)
        - **Achievement**: Restored 100% test pass rate after architectural refactor and hardened the suite against library-less environments.
        - **Status**:
            - [x] **SSoT Migration**: Resolved 25+ `NotImplementedError` points by migrating to `SettlementSystem`. ✅
            - [x] **Integrity Fixes**: Fixed stale attribute assertions in fiscal integrity tests. ✅
            - [x] **Residual Fixes**: Resolved final cascading failure points in all modules. ✅
            - [x] **Final Verification**: Result: **575 PASSED**, 1 xfailed (QE logic). 💎 ✅

    - **`Phase 10: Market Decoupling & Protocol Hardening`** 💎 ✅ (2026-02-10)
        - **Achievement**: Stateless Matching Engines & Unified Financial Protocols.
        - **Status**:
            - [x] **Market Decoupling**: Extracted `MatchingEngine` logic from `OrderBookMarket` and `StockMarket`. ✅
            - [x] **Protocol Hardening (TD-270)**: Standardized `total_wealth` and multi-currency balance access. ✅
            - [x] **Real Estate Utilization (TD-271)**: Implemented production cost reduction for firm-owned properties. ✅
            - [x] **Integrity**: Verified 0.0000% M2 leak post-implementation. ✅
