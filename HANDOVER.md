# HANDOVER: 2026-02-09 (Phase 12 Complete - Structural Integrity Restored)

## 1. Executive Summary

This session accomplished the **"Structural Regression Recovery"** and transitioned the Watchtower into an **Active Governance Cockpit**. We have successfully resolved the cascading `AttributeError`/`TypeError` issues from previous refactors, achieved **Technical Debt Zero** for core liquidation protocols, and formalized the **Crystallization Pipeline** for long-term wisdom preservation. The simulation is now verified stable with **0.0000 money leak** and **zero warnings**.

## 2. Completed Work (Phase 11 & 12 Final) ✅

| Component | Achievement | Status |
|:----------|:------------|:-------|
| **Simulation Cockpit** | Real-time policy sliders (Rates/Taxes) and M2 Integrity HUD. | ✅ |
| **Structural Repair** | Restored `Household`/`Firm` properties; hardened `HREngine` & `DemographicManager`. | ✅ |
| **Debt Zero (TD-LIQ-INV)**| Replaced `getattr` hacks with `IConfigurable` protocol in liquidation. | ✅ |
| **Finance & Judicial** | Hierarchical Seizure Waterfall and stateless Finance Command pattern. | ✅ |
| **Crystallization** | Archived 6 reports; imprinted 3 major architectural insights. | ✅ |

## 3. Road to Phase 13: "The Political Animal & Malthusian Trap" 🏛️

### 🔴 Strategic Directive: Behavioral Depth
1. **Maslow Hierarchy**: Overhaul `NeedStructure` to implement the 5-level hierarchy (Safety -> Esteem).
2. **Malthusian Calibration**: Introduce fixed `Land` factors in the `FOOD` sector to simulate historical productivity traps.
3. **Scenario Manager**: Prototype the `ScenarioManager` to trigger structured economic shocks (e.g., "The Great Famine", "Technological Boom").

## 4. Key Technical Decisions (Session 2026-02-09)

1. **API Contract Preservation**: Established the rule that public APIs must remain stable via proxy properties during internal DTO-based refactors to prevent system-wide breakage.
2. **Composite Protocols**: Introduced the pattern of combining small role-based protocols (e.g., `IFinancialAgent`, `IPropertyOwner`) into context-specific protocols (e.g., `IHousingParticipant`) to eliminate `isinstance` complexity.
3. **Uniform Tick Reset**: Standardized on a "Post-Sequence" reset phase to ensure diagnostic data (e.g., `expenses_this_tick`) remains accessible across all engine cycles within a tick.

## 5. Next Session Objectives

- **Planning**: Finalize the [Maslow Architecture Spec](file:///c:/coding/economics/design/1_governance/architecture/ARCH_MASLOW_HIERARCHY.md).
- **Implementation**: Begin the `NeedStructure` refactor for `Household` agents.
- **Verification**: Calibrate "DIMINISHING_RETURNS" in the new 3rd-factor (Land) production model.
